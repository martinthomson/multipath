I think we might also want to add a sentence in the Sec. of \"one packet number space\" explicitly specifying that \"for single PN, use ACK instead of ACK_MP\", and change some texts in the ACK_MP frame section that is related to zero-length CID (the current draft says \"if the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with 0-length Connection ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames\". ).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we really need to send \"abandon path\" in both directions?

How does the server know whether it should create a new path or not?\r\n\r\nI think in single PN, sending \"abandon path\" in both directions is helpful. When the client sends \"PATH_ABANDON\", it promises not to send non-probing packets in the current activity cycle. It could send probing packets to reactivate the path a moment later if the client thinks the network environment has changed. After sending out \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client should still be able to receive packets from the server for a while on that path because there may be the server's inflight packets on that path. It was not until the client sees the server's \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client then knows that no more server's data is to be expected except for some out-of-order packets. So after receiving \"PATH_ABANDON\", the endpoint can start preparing to free memories and clear path stats allocated for that path. The time interval from seeing \"PATH_ABANDON\" to actually releasing relevant resources is going to be an important parameter, and yes, 10-30 seconds is too long. What would be a more appropriate number for this interval? \r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the single space case, the logical test may be to check the sequence numbers of the packet. If the sequence number of the new packet is greater than that of the path_abandon, then the client is reactivating a path that was abandoned previously. Maybe the client connected again to the same network, after some disconnected interval. The server can start sending on the reactivated path. If the packet number is lower than that of the path abandon, then the server should not reactivate the path.\r\n\r\nDoes it imply that we need to track the packet number of the PATH_ABANDON for a path that is closed? When a path is in a closed state, the server may reject any newly received packets unless it is a probing packet (back to our path initialization process). In this way, it should be OK to forget any info related to that path in the last activity cycle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the multiple space case, if the CID is defined, there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n",

As the problem is similar to FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK when TCP closes, I kept the ACK in the graph (because the path_id_type=2 refers to the path where the packet is traveling, we want to make sure it is acked before we close the path.). Regarding the resource, I think if we keep a unified receive record, which is not per-path, yes, we can discard the sending resources. But if we have some path stats (e.g. how many packets received in total in this current activity cycle), we need to keep these data structures until we are sure that the peer is not going to send more packets on that path. Indeed, it depends on the implementation, but I feel it is generally helpful to have PATH_ABANDON sent in both directions.

This is basically the same issue as determining whether a connection is broken, just applied to a path. But that is not entirely sufficient, because the server needs to also infer whether the client still wants to use that path.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of non probing packets is just an heuristic. The server observes that if the client is not using the path, and deduces that it should not be using it itself. That's not a bad heuristic, but it requires the client to send some kinds of \"keep alive\" if it wants the server to continue using a path. We may debate how often that should happen. Maybe reuse the same timeout as for jettisoning paths.\r\n\r\nAnother solution may be for the client to tell something like \"please don't use that path anymore\", but that requires adding a new frame as part of the core multipath specification. In draft-liu, this was done with a specialization of the \"path status\", setting the status to \"Abandon\". Maybe we should just use a simplified for of the PATH_STATUS, leaving out the complexities of managing priorities for the advanced scheduling drafts:\r\n```\r\nABANDON_PATH Frame {\r\n  Type (i) = TBD,\r\n  Path_identifier (i),\r\n  Error Code (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase Length (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase (..),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However if we think one packet number space is mandatory to implement, it would make more sense to have it the other way around and allow fallback to one packet number space, namely if the client ask for two packet number spaces but the server supports only one but would also lead to a successful negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this?",

The first thing is to allow people more freedom. If some implementors only want to use one option, they just need to implement one code branch.  Second, single packet number space requires the modification of loss detection algorithm, the way how rtt is sampled (the overall largest ack may not be the largest acked packet on a given path), and some delayed ACK strategies, which might take additional effort. People may also want to avoid round-robin scheduling in single PN as it creates a lot of holes in the ack range, so certain things regarding performance get coupled. Christian introduced many good practices and we are currently learning from it, so we probably need more experience on that.  ",

To avoid failure for interop tests, I suggest that we could negotiate the transport parameter like this: use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more PN spaces.\r\n\r\n- 0x0: don't support multi-path\r\n- 0x1: only support multiple PN spaces for multi-path\r\n- 0x2: only support one PN space for multi-path\r\n- 0x3: support both one PN space and multiple PN space \r\n\r\nThe client could send all these 4 values in the enable_multipath transport parameter which depends on what kind of modes it supports. If the server just support one mode(such as one PN space), it could return 0x2 so that the client knows how to do next. If the server support both, it could choose 0x1 or 0x2 as it prefers, and make sure that the server don't return 0x3 as it need to decide which mode to choose. In 0x2 mode, the endpoints must not use 0-length CID.\r\n\r\nThen for people who just want one PN space, it would be ok to just support 0x2 mode. For the other guys who don't use 0-length Connection ID and want to get less overhead for ack ranges, they could choose to use 0x1 mode. And for people who want to support both 0-length CID and multiple PN spaces, they could choose 0x3 and of course it will add more modification in the implementation.\r\nMaybe this could meet everyone's need for experiments. \r\n\r\n",

I've also read through the draft itself and I think it's in a good place to support the current QUIC offload design without requiring any hardware changes. This is good.\r\n> \r\n> First thing to address is the tweaks to the AEAD nonce generation required for multipath. As we know, the non-multipath nonce generation has the hardware XOR'ing the 12B IV with the 62b pkt_num (which is left padded with zeros to 12B). For multipath, the nonce must be tweaked even more to ensure a unique nonce is always used for any multipath packet using the same key. The solution in the current draft rolls in the destination connID sequence number. This makes sense. In order to not change the hardware and still support multipath, the QUIC kernel module and/or driver must XOR in the destination connID sequence number to the IV. The result is the IV that is offloaded for the flow to the hardware. The hardware continues to do the same nonce generation with this IV XOR'ed with the pkt_num. \r\n> \r\n> Example from the multipath draft RFC:\r\n> IV: 0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Connection ID Sequence Number: 0x3\r\n> Packet Number = 0xaead\r\n> Nonce = (IV XOR ((connid_seq_num << 64) | pkt_num))\r\n> ((0x3 << 64) | 0xaead) = 0x00000003000000000000aead\r\n>     0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f (IV)\r\n> XOR 0x00000003000000000000aead ((connid_seq_num << 64) | pkt_num)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2\r\n> \r\n> Same method supporting existing offload mechanism:\r\n> IV: 0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Connection ID Sequence Number: 0x3\r\n> Packet Number = 0xaead\r\n> New IV passed in flow offload = (IV XOR (connid_seq_num << 64))\r\n>     0x6b26114b9cba2b63a9e8dd4f (IV)\r\n> XOR 0x000000030000000000000000 (connid_seq_num << 64)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e8dd4f\r\n> Nonce (hardware): (IV XOR pkt_num)\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e8dd4f (offloaded IV)\r\n> XOR 0x00000000000000000000aead (pkt_num)\r\n>     --------------------------\r\n>     0x6b2611489cba2b63a9e873e2\r\n> \r\n> Second thing is whether or not the destination connID sequence number is used in the nonce or a new path identifier. From a hardware perspective it doesn't matter. The nonce construction would be the same as I detailed above with the driver XOR'ing in the connid_seq_num or the path_id into the IV before offloading the flow. There is an implication though, as you mentioned, if the destination connID sequence number is used, the IV in the offloaded flow will change. To support this, the offloaded flow would have to be deleted from the hardware and then re-offloaded with the updated IV. Alternatively, if a unique path identifier is used, the flow would never need to be removed and re-offloaded again.\r\n> \r\n> My vote is to move the multipath design to support a unique path identifier as it's cleaner. But as you can see, it's not required from a hardware perspective. Another thing to note, the connID is part of the flow lookup on the Rx side. Simple hardware implementations would require the flow to be removed and re-offloaded with a connID change. As we've discussed with numerous customers, this is acceptable.\r\n> \r\n> Feel free to copy these ideas into this GitHub issue for further discussion: https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/25\r\n> \r\n> If you haven't seen it, we also presented QUIC offload at the last OCP Summit. This presentation complements that one Andy gave at Linux Plumbers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAvQhJSm6O8\r\n> \r\n> It's important to keep the hardware offload design as simple as possible. I don't see any need to make changes to the current offload design in order to support multipath. Let us know if you need any help with specifics going into the next IETF wg meeting. :-)\r\n> \r\n> Thanks,\r\n> - e",

With non-zero-length Connection IDs at both ends, it is indeed possible that over a same path/5-tuple, the client reaches the server using a DCID with a sequence number that is different from the sequence number of the DCID used by the server to reach the client (e.g., Figure 2). In the current draft, we consider that if the connection ID is zero-length, the packet number space identifier is 0, and applying multiple packet number spaces is thus not possible.\r\n\r\nI believe we can do better than this. Consider the situation where the client uses a non-zero length DCID to reach the server while the server uses zero-length DCID. In this case, it is the client that initiates the usage of a path with path validation, associating a server-provided non-zero-length DCID to reach the server. Once the first client's packet reaches the server on the new path, the server can associate the client's 5-tuple to the sequence number of the used Destination Connection ID, making a valid Packet Number Space Identifier. The client can easily map incoming packets on the 5-tuple to the associated DCID sequence number.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?",

For me, the issue is that when an endpoint decides to close a path, it is probably due to that the path condition is getting worse, which also means that further communication on that path may fail. When we use non-zero CID, as we should have at least one path that is working (if no path is working, the connection will be closed), and we are not constraint to send PATH_ABANDON frame on the same path that we want to close, the sender should be able to receive the ACK of PATH_ABANDON. But when we use null CID, we use path_id_type 0x02, which refers to the path where the packet is coming from, and hence, we are constraint to send PATH_ABANDON on the same path we want to close. In such a case, it is likely that the ACK of PATH_ABANDON will not be received, resulting in the \"half-open\" problem.

In\r\nthis case, QUIC must select the path over which each frame will be sent. Many PS strategies\r\nare possible and the best one will depend on the application's requirements. The PS should\r\nhave access to (an abstraction of) the congestion control state of each path to be able to determine\r\nwhether a path has enough capacity to carry a new packet. The PS also needs to have access to the\r\npath's MTU as different paths do not necessarily have the same MTU. A simple PS is a round-robin\r\nscheduler that checks the congestion window of a path before sending a QUIC packet.\r\nAnother sample PS is an algorithm that selects the path whose congestion window is open and\r\nthat has the smallest round-trip-time. This is the PS used by the Linux implementation of Multipath\r\nTCP. Note that a multipath QUIC PS will probably treat control and data packets differently. For\r\nexample, a PS could favor low delay paths to send acknowledgments and higher bandwidth\r\nones for data packets. A companion draft\r\n{{I-D.bonaventure-iccrg-schedulers}} provides several general-purpose multipath\r\npacket schedulers. \r\n```",

However, from the standpoint of security, there is no need to have \"probing\" state that forbids an endpoint from sending most types of frames.\r\n\r\nIIRC, the only reason we have the distinction of probing packets and non-probing packets in QUIC v1 is because QUIC v1 has only one loss recovery and congestion controller. As there is one, a QUIC v1 endpoint has to send signal that indicates to peer the change of the active path (i.e., the path that uses loss recovery and congestion controller) - that is what non-probing packets are used for.\r\n\r\nWith Multipath QUIC, we have per-path loss recovery and congestion control.

For example, you may have a mental model of an application use one stream for video, another for audio, and another for data, but there are applications that use one separate stream for each video frame, leading to very different ways of doing scheduling. Or, we see what Ali Baba has done for video download, using redundant transmission on multiple paths to minimize buffering of videos. That's very interesting, but is very different from simply scheduling streams on specific paths. \r\n\r\nWe are barely scratching the surface of what can be possible. Scheduling decisions depend on applications, and applications are not blocked. Information about priorities, expected completion time and the like can be carried in application protocols. Nothing stops developers of QUIC stack from providing applications with scheduling control APIs. Delaying standardization of scheduling will not stop deployments. It seems prudent to not standardize too soon.\r\n",

There are deployments and applications that would like to restrict the amount of data or bandwidth that is sent on a given path. A typical example is a smartphone that does not want to use too much data on cellular but has no restriction on WiFi. As in MPTCP, we need a connection-level MAX_DATA that limits the amount of data which can be in flight. In MPTCP, this corresponds to the receive window and the same window is advertised over all subflows. We could not do better than this within the IETF. \r\n\r\nIn MPQUIC, there is an opportunity to send a per-path MAX_DATA to restrict the utilization of a path or define other control frames to specify the maximum allowed bandwidth per path. \r\n\r\nWe might discuss whether we should include this functionality in version 1 or leave it to another draft.\r\n\r\n",

There are two transport parameters that could warrant some discussion:\r\n\r\n- disable_active_migration : This transport parameter is incompatible with enable_multipath.

A client constructs packets using any previously unused active connection ID, taken from either the \r\n  preferred_address transport parameter or a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\n  As soon as path validation succeeds, the client SHOULD begin sending all future packets to the new server address using the \r\n  new connection ID and discontinue use of the old server address. If path validation fails, the client MUST continue sending all \r\n  future packets to the server's original IP address.\r\n\r\nFor multipath, do we want to be stronger than SHOULD select one ?

One number space per path should be more efficient, because implementations can directly reuse the loss-recovery logic specified for QUIC\r\n* ACK size. Single space leads to lots of out of order delivery, which causes ACK sizes to grow\r\n* Simplicity of code. Single space can be implemented without adding mane new code paths to uni-path QUIC\r\n* Shorter header. Single space works well with NULL length CID\r\n\r\nThe picoquic implementation shows that \"efficiency\" and \"ack size\" issues of single space implementations can be mitigated. However, that required significant improvements in the code:\r\n\r\n* to obtain good loss efficiency, picoquic remembers not just the path on which a packet was sent, but also the order of the packet on this path, i.e. a \"virtual sequence number\". The loss detection logic then operates on that virtual sequence number.\r\n\r\n* to contain ACK size, picoquic implements a prioritization logic to select the most important ranges in an ACK, avoid acking the same range more than 3 or 4 times, and keep knowledge of already acknowledged ranges so range coalescing works.\r\n\r\nI think these improvements are good in general, and I will keep them in the implementations whether we go for single space or not. The virtual sequence number is for example useful if the CID changes for reasons not related to path changes in multiple number space variants. It is also useful in unipath variants to avoid interference between sequence numbers used in probes and the RACK logic. The ACK size improvements do reduce the size of ACKs in presence of out of order delivery, e.g., if the network is doing some kind of internal load balancing. On the other hand, the improvements are somewhat complex, would need to be described in separate drafts, and pretty much contradicts the \"simplicity of code\" argument.\r\n\r\nSo we are left with the \"Null length CID\" issue. I see for cases:\r\n\r\nClient CID | Sender CID | Support | Priority\r\n-----------|------------|-----------|------------\r\nlong | long | Supported in both variants | Used by many implementations\r\nNULL | long | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Preferred configuration of many big deployments\r\nlong | NULL | Requires special support in multiple spaces case, but could work | Rarely used, server load balancing does not work\r\nNULL | NULL | Does not work for multiple spaces | Only mentioned in some P2P deployments\r\n\r\nThe point here is that it is somewhat hard to deploy a large server with NULL CID and use server load balancing. This configuration is mostly favored by planned P2P deployments.",

Use of a single packet number space might not support ECN.\r\n\r\nRegarding the unified solution: I think what you actually say is that we would specify both solutions and everybody would need to implement both logics. At least regarding the \"simplicity of code\" argument, that would be the worst choice.\r\n\r\nIf we can make the multiple packet number spaces solution work with one-sided CIDs, I'm tending toward such an approach. Use of multiple packet number spaces avoids ambiguity/needed \"smartness\" in ACK handling and packet scheduling which, as you say above, can make the implementation more complex and, moreover,  wrong decisions may have large impact on efficient (both local processing and on-the-wire). I don't think we want to leave these things to each implementation individually.",

          "body": "The summary Christian made above about design comparison sounds indeed quite accurate. Besides ECN, my other concern about single packet number is that it require cleverness from the receiver side if you want to be performant in some scenarios. At the sender-side, you need to consider a path-relative packet number threshold instead of an absolute one to avoid spurious losses.\r\n\r\nJust a point I think we did not mentioned yet is that there can be some interactions between Multipath out-of-order number delivery and incoming packet number duplicate detection. This requires maintaining some state at the receiver side, as described by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#section-12.3-12. With single packet number space, the receiver should take extra care when updating the \"minimum packet number below which all packets are immediately dropped\". Otherwise, in presence of paths with very different latencies, the receiver might end up discarding packets from a (slower) path.\r\n\r\nI'm also preferring the multiple packet number spaces solution for the above reasons. I'm not against thinking for a \"unified\" solution (the proposal sounds interesting), but I wonder how much complexity this would add compared to requiring end hosts to use one-byte CIDs.",

My take is:\r\n\r\n* If a node uses NULL CID and proposes support of multipath, then that node MUST implement code to deal with size of acknowledgements.\r\n* If a node sees a peer using NULL CID and supporting multipath, then that node MUST either use only one path at a time or implement code to deal with impact on loss detection due to out of order arrivals, and impact on congestion control including ambiguity of ECN signals.\r\n\r\nThen add sections on what it means to deal with the side of acknowledgements, out of order arrivals, and congestion control.\r\n\r\nI think this approach ends up with the correct compromises:\r\n\r\n* It keeps the main case simple. Nodes that rely on multipath just use long CID and one number space per CID.\r\n* Nodes that use long CID never have to implement the ACK length minimization algorithms.\r\n* Nodes that see a peer using NULL CID have a variety of implementation choices, e.g., sending on just one path at a time, sending on mostly one path at a time in \"make or break\" transitions, or implementing sophisticated algorithms.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, we can get rid of the single vs multiple space discussion, and end up with a single solution addressing all use cases.",

If the connection ID was used by the peer to identify a path from the peer to this endpoint, the resources include the list of received packets used to send acknowledgements. The peer MAY decide to keep sending data using the same IP addresses and UDP ports previously associated with the connection ID, but MUST use a different connection ID when doing so.\r\n\r\n  So retiring associated CID only cause the resources belonging to the corresponding packet number space to be released, but not the whole path to be closed. In CID migration cases, endpoints just want to retire the old CID and use a new one, as path is defined as \"refers to the 4-tuple\"  in the current draft, this operation will not cause the whole path context (including congestion control states, RTT measurements, etc.) to be removed.\r\n\r\n2. Path closing is triggered by PATH_ABANDONED frame, and does not have dependency on CID retiring (Although path closing would trigger the retirement of CID resource). So when path_state transmit from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\", the proper condition might be \"Acknowledgement of PATH_ABANDONED frame received\" or \"Path's draining timeout for at least 3 times the current PTO interval\".\r\n",

          "body": "First, regarding the transitioning from a \"closing\" state to a \"closed\" state, there will be a problem if we use the receipt of the ACK of a PATH_ABANDON as a condition for the transitioning due to possible out-of-order delivery. Suppose a client uses DCID S2 to on its first path to send three pkts with the packet number 100, 101, and 102, where PATH_ABANDON frame is sent in packet 102. However, due to the out-of-order delivery, it is possible that 102 is acked first, while packet 100 and 101 are still in flight. Therefore, at this point, we cannot mark the first path as \"closed\" since it is also possible that the acks of those two packets will later return from the first path. Due to the above reasons, in the initial design, we say that the path should be closed after CIDs are retired. As shown in the path-closing figure (Fig.3) in the draft, after the client makes sure that the packets (100, 101) sent before PATH_ABANDON on path 1 are also acknowledged, it then decides that the CID S2 is no longer needed, and thus sending out the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame.\r\n\r\nSecond, regarding the transitioning from an \"active\" state to a \"closed\" state, yes, it is possible that we want to retire the old CID and use a new one, and I think the current figure is a bit confusing.  The purpose of this transitioning is to handle exceptions and it basically says that when there are no available CIDs to use for communication on a particular path, we should close it. I think we can simply keep the \"path's timeout\" as the condition because when there are no available CIDs, the path timeout will be triggered anyway.",

We could instead have an intermediate \"Idle\" state in which as long as you have no associated CID, keep relevant recovery/RTT/... contexts.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think it could be worthwhile to make a clearer distinction between the acknowledgment/packet number context and the recovery one. For instance, if for any reason a host changes the DCID used over a given path, it should still keeps track of packets sent with the previous DCID (and thus possibly sent with a different packet number space).\r\n\r\nFor the \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" transition, I tend to agree with Yunfei and I would not directly rely on the acknowledgment of the PATH_ABANDON frame to close my path. But as a sender, I can react to the acknowledgment of my PATH_ABANDON frame and send the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. On the other hand, relying on 3*PTO to transition from \"Closing\" to \"Closed\" is probably more relevant than using the path's idle timeout.",

So we are pretty much left to peer to peer scenarios, in which the server is a single computer.

A peer MAY advertise \"at most\" this limit.\r\n\r\n2) there is no guarantee that a peer will advertise \"at least\" the `active_connection_id_limit`. For example, a node could decide to never advertise more than 3 CID, even if its peer's limit is 9.\r\n\r\n3) if a node reuses a non-zero-length CID on a different path mimics, the peer is most likely to treat that as a \"NAT rebinding\" event. There will be an exchange of probes, after which the peer will retain either the old or the new path. Thus, there can never be more active paths than the `active_connection_id_limit`.\r\n\r\n4) Since a new path requires a new connection ID in each direction, the maximum number of paths cannot be higher than the lowest of the two `active_connection_id_limit` advertised by both peers.\r\n\r\nI think the issue boils down to \"how does a node refuse to establish a new path\". Imagine a node with a hard limit to maximum two simultaneous paths per connection, but advertising 3 CIDs. With RFC 9000 the only option would be to ignore incoming challenges for new paths. The peer will see timeouts, and repeat the challenges a number of time before giving up. If the peer knew that the local node supports at most two paths, it might not bother sending new challenges in the first place, saving some time. But there are synchronization issues.\r\n\r\nThe peer may or may not know how many paths are currently active. For example, one of the current paths may have been abandoned, and the peer does not know that yet. So if we create a \"max path\" mechanism, we also need some kind of synchronization mechanism. Or, we could add a soft-error mechanism of some kind, something like a \"CHALLENGE_REFUSED\" frame, maybe carrying an error reason. But we would have to work out the complexity, etc.\r\n\r\nLooks like something we could do later, maybe an extension on top of the basic multipath.\r\n\r\n",

However, there is still sth that is not quite clear to me. You mentioned Kalman filter. My understanding is that your state vector is the one-way-delay for each path in each direction. For example, if I have N paths, then I could write down s=[OWD_inbound_1, ...., OWD_inbound_N, OWD_outbound_1,... OWD_outbound_N]. For the process equation, we can write s_(k+1) = s_k + w_k, where w_k is the process noise/disturbance. The difficult part in the problem is that in the observation equation H is a random matrix, which means in each measurement y, y could be the combination of two one-way delays that the combination could change each time. So to me,  at the first glance, the problem is a bit different from the Kalman's formulation whose observation is y = H*s + v, where v is the noise term and H is fixed. I think this is not that relevant, but I am really curious to learn the technique. ",

That would be a bit too CPU intensive. Also, the Kalman filter is trying for a min-square estimate, which works well for Gaussian variables but is only an approximation for the kind of probability distributions that we are likely to encounter. Implementing a more precise Kalman filter would be more precisely wrong...",

When using Identifier Type 0, the Path Identifier corresponds to the sequence number of the Source CID of the sender, hence the sequence number of the Destination CID used by the receiver to send packets on the related path.\r\n\r\nWhile there are obvious values that could be considered as bad and may lead to, e.g., a MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION (e.g., a sequence number larger than any sequence number advertised), I don't think we should be as radical with regular values as they might have been retired meanwhile (also possible to face this with packet reordering). The worst edge cases I see are the followings.\r\n\r\nWith type 1, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID in one packet, and then the RETIRE_CID retiring that CID in a subsequent one, but the RETIRE_CID reaches the receiver before the PATH_ABANDON one. If the receiver drops state upon RETIRE_CID reception, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nWith type 0, the sender might send a PATH_ABANDON with the seq of the CID, but before it reaches the peer, the peer sends a RETIRE_CID retiring that CID. If the receiver drops the CID state upon RETIRE_CID sending, it won't be able to map the PATH_ABANDON to the path.\r\n\r\nHandling these edge cases with connection closure is clearly too strong. Still, ignoring or even acknowledging these PATH_ABANDON may have bad consequences. Silently dropping packets (i.e., not acknowledge the packet having PATH_ABANDON) will make the peer retransmit the frame (hoping it updates its path identifier) but could cause the loss/non-acknowledgment of accompanying frames (e.g., STREAM ones), and processing packet content without acknowledging it sounds odd. Acknowledging PATH_ABANDON that cannot be mapped to a path would make some desynchronisation about the status of the path between the peers (the sender now assumes the path is closed, but the receiver not).\r\n\r\nTo address the type 1 issue, we could write some text stating that a sender cannot retire a DCID if a PATH_ABANDON containing the related sequence number is still in flight. But for the type 0, the fix is not obvious (I don't think we could have the same solution as in #135)...",

Yes, keep alive becomes a bit tricky in multipath, because the client may want to select how many paths it wants to keep alive, and which ones. For example, a client with Wi-Fi and cellular may want to keep the cellular path alive, because it will survive a mobility event. It may want to do that even if it is sending traffic over Wi-Fi. That's a local implementation decision. How they do that, however, is straightforward: send a Ping on the path that you want to keep alive.\r\n\r\nI think we should let implementers decide what they want to do. If we do add some text, is should be about keep alive, not about ping. Something like:\r\n```\r\n## Keep Alive\r\n\r\nThe QUIC specification defines an optional keep alive process, see {{Section 5.3 of RFC9000}}.\r\nImplementations of the multipath extension should consider whether this keep alive process\r\nshould be applied to at least one path, all the paths, no path, or a specific subset of the paths.\r\nDifferent applications will likely require different strategies.

I'm also not sure that an endhost is required to use available DCIDs \"in-sequence\" (i.e., it may use the CID with seq 2 before using the CID with seq 1).\r\n\r\nBasically, let's consider the following example. Assume a two path scenario where the client uses DCID seq 0 on a path A and DCID seq 2 on a path B. At some point (e.g., the server might notice a NAT rebinding on path B), the server would like the client to retire the DCID with seq 2. The only way the server could force this behaviour is to send NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames with Retire Prior To set to 3, which would force the client to send RETIRE_CID frames. However, doing so would also force the client to retire DCID seq 0, which might not be required/needed/wanted.\r\n\r\nFWIW, [one of the previous multipath proposals](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-deconinck-quic-multipath/07/) proposed to let the CID issuer split the CIDs into \"uniflow spaces\", i.e., pre-assign CIDs to specific paths. Such a design enables retiring a specific CID using the Retire Prior To without affecting the other paths, as the CID seq is path-specific. However, such a solution adds more complexity than the current draft, which is likely not desirable.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I'm not sure with the current proposal the aforementioned issue is a big one, but it would indeed deserve some documentation/discussion in the draft.",

If we tie it to something else, we are just moving the problem, because then we have to worry about mapping the CID to a path ID.\r\n\r\nYes, this has a couple of constraints. If a CID is actually retired, there is not way to acknowledge the packets that were sent using that CID. Effectively, they are treated as lost. The obvious solution is to write \"don't do that\" guidelines. Basically, wait a couple RTO before retiring a CID, so the ACK have time to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe other constraint is that ACK-MP carry the ID used when sending the packets. This is not a huge constraint, but it is an exception to the proposed \"same path for ACK\" policy. But the main argument for that same path policy is about computing timers. That argument does not really apply when renewing the CID.\r\n\r\nSame issue for the path abandon. If packets are sent on the same four tuple with a new CID, just abandon that.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "In addition to the encryption consideration as mentioned above. I remember there was another reason why the sequence number of CID was chosen to identify a path. It brings us back to the definition of what is a path and what is a path identifier.\r\n\r\nBy definition of the draft and RFC9000, a path is defined by a 4-tuple {source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number}, and a path ID is an identifier used to identify a path. That means we need to construct a mapping between a path ID and the associated 4-tuple.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are couple of issues. First, the client's view and the server's view of the 4-tuple are not the same due to NAT.  Second, the 4-tuple can change due to (1) network path migration (think about the case where our phone's wifi is connected to a wifi router that has two outbound networks to the internet, one wireline and one satellite, and the router can switch between the two), and (2) NAT rebinding. If we use a constant path ID, then the path ID does not uniquely identify a 4-tuple, but instead, there will be a one-to-many mappings from a path ID to 4-tuples. \r\n\r\nIn #179, Quentin proposed to use entry point IDs to identify a path, I think this identification is stable in the case of NAT rebinding, where the 4-tuple changes but the physical path is actually unchanged. However, the problem is that when the underlying path has changed (in the above case, a router may switch packet from the wireline to the satellite to perform failover) while the entry point IDs on the end-hosts remain unchanged, then we end up using the same path identifier to identify different paths.\r\n\r\nThese problems can be solved when using QUIC's CID sequence number to identify a path. First, it allows the client and server to identify a path separately as they see different 4-tuples. Second, when 4-tuple changes, we eventually use new CIDs to communicate and thus, the mapping between a path ID and the 4-tuple remains as a one-to-one mapping. Third, we are logically correct in the case when the physical path indeed has migrated while the endhost interfaces are not changed.\r\n\r\n",

You have a code object holding the list of packets to acknowledge (receiver side), or an object containing the list of packets not acknowledged yet (sender side). These objects are tied to the connection ID. Nothing particularly complicated there: the sender knows exactly which connection ID it uses for a given packet; the receiver knows exactly what connection ID was carried in the packets that it received.\r\n\r\nThe issue that you mention comes from the ambiguity of \"Abandon Path\", \"Retire connection ID\", and \"retire previous connection ID\". We have to be clear about what that means:\r\n\r\n* Abandon Path means \"please do not send any more packets on that path\". No ambiguity there. It also implies: \"you can free the resource of that path at your convenience\". We need to specify how and when, there is some leeway.\r\n* Retire Connection ID\" means \"I have deleted all resource tied to the connection ID on my side\", which implies \"I will not use this connection ID to send any new packet\" and also \"I will not accept any new MP-ACK sent using the sequence number of that CID\".\r\n* \"retire previous CID\" means \"please retire these CID quickly\". RFC 9000 says \"The endpoint SHOULD continue to accept the previously issued connection IDs until they are retired by the peer\", so there is some leeway.\r\n\r\nSo I guess we have the following actions:\r\n\r\n* A node decides to stop using a CID, i.e., not send any more packet using that CID. The node can do that at any time on its own will, and SHOULD do that immediately after receiving an Abandon_Path frame, or after receiving a \"retire before\" indication.\r\n* The node should wait 3*RTO after that decision, so pending acknowledgements have enough time to arrive.\r\n* After 3*RTO, the node deletes the local resource, including the list of packets not acknowledged yet. Those packets should be considered lost.\r\n* The node then sends a Retire Connection ID frame.\r\n* The node receiving the Retire Connection ID frame deletes the resource associated with the CID, i.e., the list of packets to acknowledge. If the peer did wait long enough before sending Retire Connection ID frame, that list should be empty. If it is not, too bad, it can still be deleted, these packets will never be acknowledged, but the sender of the CID does not care.\r\n* After that, a node can still received an MP-ACK or an Abandon_Path mentioning an old CID, because we do have race conditions. Such frames should be silently ignored.\r\n\r\nDoes that remove the ambiguities? ",

Also, if the peer has no timing restrictions about when retiring a CID, this is fine as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, when receiving a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a \"Retire Prior To\" field forcing the receiver to remove DCIDs, RFC 9000 states that \"Upon receipt of an increased Retire Prior To field, the peer MUST stop using the corresponding connection IDs and retire them with RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames before adding the newly provided connection ID to the set of active connection IDs.\". Not sure the receiver of the NEW_CONNECTION_ID may delay the retirement of DCIDs for a long period. Once retired, the host cannot reference the paths identified by the retired CIDs in, i.e., PATH_ABANDON frames, which may be an issue if the peer does not provide enough new CIDs.\r\n\r\nBut the current path identification is fragile when one host (the client) changes the DCID used over a *same perceived* 4-tuple, but that the other (the server) *perceives a different* 4-tuple (typical case of NAT rebinding). The client will keep a single view of that path, but the server will have two different views having different 4-tuples and Path IDs for an actual same path, hence bringing path identification ambiguity here.\r\n\r\n@yfmascgy As long as the 4-tuple does not change, there is no \"path change\" from the QUIC viewpoint. Having \"backbone router path migration\" will be transparent to the endmost (although the path characteristic conditions such as the latency and bandwidth may change). The EntryPoint ID proposal is mainly to keep stable path identification in PATH_ABANDON/PATH_STATUS frames when 1) CIDs change and the sender's perceived 4-tuple is stable but the receiver's perceived 4-tuple is not, and 2) when there is no more usable CID over the (network) path to reference.",

This is actually a recommended behavior, for privacy reasons, so we have better get it right.\r\n\r\nI think that the current proposal mostly works. After the migration, the new packets sent by the client will be tied to the new CID on both sides -- see previous points about tying number space to connection IDs. There is no ambiguity about packet number space, packets will be correctly acknowledged, etc. The Abandon_Path or MP_ACK frames will not be ambiguous: they refer to the number space, not to the abstract concept of Path.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the server will probably NOT treat the incoming packet with a new CID as a \"nat rebinding\". The algorithm pretty much defines NAT rebinding as \"same CID, different addresses or ports\". The conforming server will treat that as a new path, perform address validation, etc. If the server tries to use the old \"path\", the packets will be dropped by the NAT. The connection will recover eventually, but after some packet losses, and yes, that's not desirable.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest solution is for the client to somehow tell the server what it is doing. \"These packets carry CID sequence number 7.

The only difficult case is when the client uses a new CID and the tuple changes (NAT rebinding) at the same time. Note that a NAT rebinding is improbable if packets were recently received on the old path (also see section [9.3.3 in RFC9000](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-9.3.3)). A NAT rebinding mostly happens if a path is idle for some time, but that is already managed by the [4.3.4 in the current draft](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-idle-timeout):\r\n\r\n\"Hosts SHOULD stop sending traffic on a path if for at least the period of the idle timeout as specified in [Section 10.1.](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-10.1.) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)] (a) no non-probing packet was received or (b) no non-probing packet sent over this path was acknowledged, but MAY ignore that rule if it would disqualify all available paths.\"\r\n\r\nIn other word, if a path is idle long enough such that the 4-tuple is changed by NAT, it should have already been closed except there is only one path left. Therefore, the chance that the server sees (1) >=2 active paths and (2) a packet that has a new CID and a new 4-tuple at the same time is low.\r\n\r\nWhen the server sees (1) >=2 active paths and (2)  a packet that has a new CID and a new 4-tuple, the issue is that we don't know which path the packet belongs to. Hence, we just treat it as an attempt for a new path as @mirjak suggested. However, in the current draft, when the client initiates a new path, the packet should contain a PATH_CHALLENGE frame (see [figure 2](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-path-establishment)). If the packet does not contain PATH_CHALLENGE, we should just ignore the packet, which eventually leads to path closure as specified by the current draft (see [figure 1](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#fig-path-states)). Note that in doing so, we are also resilient to the attacks mentioned by @qdeconinck that \"the client may frequently rotate the DCID it uses over a path for legitimate purposes, but an on-path attacker may tweak the 4-tuple, hoping it will make it create a lot of (invalid) paths' states at server side\". \r\n\r\nWhen the server sees (1) only 1 active path and (2) a packet of a new CID and a new 4-tuple but that packet does not have PATH_CHALLENGE, it knows which path the packet belongs to, and we just follow what single path QUIC does and the behavior of multipath quic and single path quic converge in this case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think the current draft can already address the issue, and we probably just want to stick to what we have with some minor modifications.",

Is there any good reason why we don't keep the Path ID constant over the life time of a path?\" \r\n\r\nI think we should just bite the bullet, and acknowledge that retiring a CID makes it unusable in the future -- MP frames mentioning the corresponding ID will just be silently ignored. Yes, this can cause for example some spurious packet loss detection, but that can be minimized with strict rules about when to retire a CID -- the various RTO guidelines that we discussed in other threads. Better expose the consequence clearly, so nodes that think of retiring a CID think twice.",

The fundamental issue is that in reality a path is only precisely defined by the sequence of every possible hops between two endpoints, but that can not be observed by the endpoint, so we have to use the 4-tuple definition of a path as a simplified and compromised notation that unfortunately does not capture the full picture. QUIC goes around this issue with the use of connection ID, so that we are not bothered by unstable path identifiers and can enable path migration. Therefore, I feel in multipath QUIC, we may want to inherit what QUICv1 does and reuse the CID mechanism to identify paths.",

      "body": "I think given the dynamic nature of the CID usage on paths that leads to some existing design issues(see #137, #158), it is worth having some stable path identification (to address, e.g., #169).\r\n\r\n# What does not change\r\n\r\nI think we now agree that a Multipath QUIC connection uses different Connection IDs on different paths, and each Connection ID has its own packet number space. Such a design enables end-hosts to easily receive packets and decrypt them without assuming anything about the network path (relying directly on the perceived 4-tuple makes the approach fragile). Note that we keep the ACK_MP as it (i.e., we acknowledge packet numbers that used a specific DCID).\r\n\r\n# Identifying network paths (until now)\r\n\r\nSo far, end hosts directly maps the (Destination) Connection ID sequence number as the path identifier of the network path. This path identifier is then used in the path-specific frames (PATH_ABANDON, PATH_STATUS,\u2026). Such an approach has the advantage that we do not have to define additional signalling to identify a network path, and it is relatively easy to track that. However, this means that if one endhost changes the DCID it uses over a given path, this means its identifier changes. Having such dynamic changing identifiers for a stable path causes design issues when using an identifier no more valid in the path-specific frames.\r\n\r\n# Proposal: explicit path identification advertisement during path validation\r\n\r\nThe path validation process establish the identification of a path through the advertisement of the \u201cEntry Point ID\u201d (EPID) used by the packet sender. Each path is identified by a tuple (local EPID, peer EPID). This identification is then used in the path-specific frames to identify the concerned path. Note that each endhost uses EPID 0 on the initial path.\r\n\r\nThis implies that we need an augmented version of the PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE frames (let\u2019s say PATH_CHALLENGE_MP/PATH_REPSONSE_MP) that include the EPID that the sender used to send the frame.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s consider this initial situation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  DCID 0 EPID 0                   DCID 0 EPID 0\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                    |\r\nClient                               Server\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this initial state, each endhost has one path:\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n\r\nFrom the server perspective, we have\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n\r\nNow the client wants to create a new path on a new local address, but still on the same server address (same IP and port at server side). When the server just processed the PATH_CHALLENGE_MP(data, EPID=1) sent by the client with DCID seq 1, we have this state:\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, ???) using DCID seq 1\r\n\r\nServer\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1\r\n\r\nNote that the server can figure out at packet reception on which local address it saw, and thus map the corresponding local EPID to the new seen path. The server can then replies with a PATH_RESPONSE_MP(data, EPID=0) (and also initiates a PATH_CHALLENGE_MP as well). Assume here it uses the DCID with seq 2. Once the PATH_RESPONSE_MP is received by the client, we have this state.\r\n\r\nClient\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using DCID seq 1 and SCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nNow the client can refer to the lower path in PATH_STATUS/PATH_ABANDON frame using (1, 0), and the server could use (1, 0). Note that it makes also possible to extend these frames to the set of paths sharing a given EPID. This tuple is stable as long as end hosts do not change the EPID they use when performing further path validations.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  DCID 0 EPID 0                   DCID 0 EPID 0\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n   |                                    |\r\nClient                               Server\r\n   |                                    |\r\n   +------------------------------------+\r\n  DCID 1 EPID 1                   DCID 2 EPID 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider now a specific edge case, that is also hard to handle with the current (CID identification) design: the client decides to change the DCID it uses (now seq 2) on its path (EPID 1, EPID 0), but the very first packet sent experiences a NAT rebinding, making the server see a new 4-tuple. The end hosts\u2019 states just after the server received that packet is\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID ???) using SCID seq 2\r\n\r\nTo address this new unknown path, the server will initiate path validation over that new path using a new DCID (let\u2019s say with seq 3), so it sends a MP_PATH_CHALLENGE(EPID=0) on the lower path. Once the packet reaches and after its processing, we have\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 3 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 1 and DCID seq 2\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID ???) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 3\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the client replies with a MP_PATH_RESPONSE on its perceived EPID (hence EPID 1) and the response can reach the server, which can then figure out that the path is actually the same as the previous one (it experienced involuntary 4-tuple change, this is not a new path). The final state is hence\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 1, EPID 0) using SCID seq 3 and DCID seq 2\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 0) using SCID seq 0 and DCID seq 0\r\n- (EPID 0, EPID 1) using SCID seq 2 and DCID seq 3\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional remarks\r\n\r\nIntroducing such additional identifiers may require additional care to cope with EPID that change over a same address or to avoid a same EPID over multiple 4-tuples. I think we can require that new EPID values cannot decrease (monotonically increasing) and observing a same EPID coming from different addresses probably indicates that something is wrong there.\r\n\r\nWe can also extend the required state of a path to be \"Active\", i.e., we need to have both local and peer EPID of a path before considering it as active.\r\n\r\nHaving two endpoint-specific values instead of a single shared one (as suggested by #170) may be desirable to support the edge case mentioned above.",

The frame is sent by the initiating endpoint and includes relevant information (see below). When received by the peer, the peer responds with a `PATH_SETUP` frame in the opposite direction with reciprocal information (an alternative is to have a separate frame type for the path setup response).\r\n\r\nIf there is a worry that the protocol specifications will run out of single-byte (6-bit) frame types, the new frame type could be given a type number in the two-byte (14-bit) range since it will be sent very infrequently.\r\n\r\n# Frame content\r\n\r\n## Path identifier\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons for a stable path identifier (see #179). Having the same path identifier in both directions simplify both the implementations and things like correlating traces taken at the two endpoints (#170).\r\n\r\nThe unique identifier for the new path is selected by the endpoint that initiates the new path. To simplify path initiation also from the server, clients use even path identifiers and servers use odd path identifiers when they initiate new paths. Path identifiers are never reused.\r\n\r\n## Path status\r\n\r\nThe `PATH_STATUS` frame is used to set the status of an existing path (`available` or `standby`). The status of a new path should be signaled directly at path setup, otherwise the peer might start to use a new path that is intended to be `standby` before it gets the `PATH_STATUS` frame.\r\n\r\n## Path parameters\r\n\r\nSome parameters of a new path can be different from what was negotiated for the original path at connection setup. They are signaled in the `PATH_SETUP` frame.\r\n\r\nExamples of per-path parameters: `max_udp_payload_size`, `max_idle_timeout`, `max_ack_delay`.\r\n",

ACK/ACK_MP frames in multipath acknowledge packets using a specific DCID. The issue here is that there is a one-to-many relation between a 4-tuple and the Path ID (i.e., the sequence number of the DCID used). Relying on the 4-tuple to infer the DCID that may lead to acknowledgment ambiguities here.\r\n\r\nConsider for the example the case where a client decides to rotate the DCID it uses over a given path every 2 packets (we could also consider a timer-based change where the DCID change occurs in the middle of a sending burst). It then sends over that path DCID 1 PN 0, DCID 1 PN 1, DCID 2 PN 0 and DCID 2 PN 1. What should the server sends here? If it relies on the largest DCID sequence number seen, it may send ACK(0-1), but from the client perspective, such indication is unclear (especially if, e.g., one of the packets sent with DCID 1 has been lost).",

Resetting the packet number with a new CID makes decryption easier, however, after you have decrypted the packet you may still be able to assign to an existing path.\r\n\r\nActually it is not a problem neither for decryption nor for path assignment, if only the 4-tuple or the CID changes. The problem is that if the client changes the CID, it never can be sure if not also the 4-tuple changes (which can even be likely after an idea period). Therefore the client need to reset the packet number for easy decryption when it uses a new CID (this is deviation from RFC9000 - just to note but that's probably fine). However, to my understanding just changeing the CID and reseting the packet number without a change in 4-tuple doesn't necessarily mean that this will create a new path, e.g. the server doesn't have to start validation and you don't have to close the old path as it is the same. So while you need to update your mapping from CID to path ID, I don't think the path ID has to change. This is the discussion we should have in #169.",

However this needs more discussion as there are multiple options which all my have some problems.\r\n\r\nOption 1) The current PR creates two new frames. The idea of this change was to make it easy to add potential new status value in future by simply adding a new frame. However, having separate frames means the frames may arrive in different orders. In PATH_STATUS we had a frame sequence number; but to guarantee order among frames, this would mean all \"path-status\" frames would need to share a seq number space. I don't think that would be a complicated solution to implement but it does not feel like a clean design to have these dependencies among frames.\r\n\r\nOption 2) We could have a one PATH_STANDBY frame which always contains a full list of all CID seq numbers that should have this state and as such any update would always replace the old state. That means we could signal multiple updates in one frame, which can beneficial e.g. if you change CIDs on all paths, and further we would not need the PATH_AVAILABLE frame at all. However, this only works with two path states and also not if we in future want to define another path status frame. However, are we sure we need different exclusive states? E.g. If you would later define a path priority, this information can be orthogonal to the standby information rather than replacing it.\r\n\r\nOption 3) Only allow sending of path status information on the same path that the updates applies to and use the packet number for ordering. However, this means you cannot \"assign\" status information to a CID before the CID is used which at least theoretically would be possible with the other solutions. However, maybe it's sufficient to ensure that if a new CID is used the respective path status frame is sent in the first packet with this new CID. Not sure how complicated that would be for some implementations. Also is using packet number for order a good choice? Might also be complicated for some implementations...?\r\n\r\nOr Option 4, I guess, is to keep the current PATH_STATUS frame (and find a different way to make it extensible or make any future extensive a full replacement).",

I do not think that there is additional complexity with sharing the sequence number with multiple frames that update path status. In my view, we are merely merging the Path Status field that exists today into the frame type.\r\n\r\nAs to option 2, people who want to update states of all paths at once can do that with option 1, by sending multiple frames covering all paths at once in a single packet. Therefore, option 1 is a superset of option 2.\r\n\r\nRe option 3, yeah it would be complicated for some QUIC stacks. IIUC, there are two types of stacks; when a packet is lost, some QUIC stacks regenerate frames. Other QUIC stacks remember what has been sent in the encoded form and simply retransmit them. For the latter, it is hard to exclude frames carrying old information upon retransmission.",

There are four options, all with some drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* server notices that there is no \"PATH_CHALLENGE\" in the packet, which means the client probably did not intend to create a new path. That may be a fine heuristic, but it does not tell the server which path was the old path. The server will have to do some guesswork, e.g., look for three-tuple matching (destination-IP, destination-port, source-IP), or for two-and-a-half-tuple matching (destination-IP, destination-port, prefix of source-IP). It would then do as suggested in \"NAT Rebinding\", i.e., challenge both paths and pick the one that responds.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID(old CID) with the first packet after the migration. This has a major drawback: it prevents the server from sending new acknowledgements for packets received on the old path.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a PATH_ABANDON(old CID, reason = CID RETIRED) with the first packet after the migration. This creates a possible confusion, because PATH_ABANDON normally means abandon the path, not abandon the CID. We could see implementation errors.\r\n\r\n* client bundles a newly defined ABANDON_CID(old CID) frame with the first packet after the migration. The server realize that the client was merely trying to rotate the CID but that a path rebinding happened, and avoids sending new packets on the old path. \r\n\r\nThe last option is the best: indicate clearly the client intent, avoid extra traffic, avoid potential side effects. But all bundling solution have the issue that this \"first packet\" may be lost, and that the net packet will be received without the bundled data. This is probably OK since we are trying to solve a performance issue: the old path will be abandoned eventually, after idle timeout or after receiving a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. Or, if the first packet with the new CID does not include the ABANDON_CID frame, the server may fall back to the first option: notice that there is no path challenge, etc.",

This appears relevant for the reason in that A can't determine if this path change only results was the result of a basic NAT binding with a source port change from B's perspective. But, I think there are a couple of corner cases, like two layer NATs with some failover where the packet could actually exit through a different NAT closest to B than previous and more substantially be a different route.

      "body": "The current text says that \"ACK_MP frame (defined in {{ack-mp-frame}}) SHOULD be sent on (the same) path.\"  (The exact wording will change as part of PR #185 but the meaning will be the same.) The next sentence says \"However, an ACK_MP frame can be returned via a\r\ndifferent path, based on different strategies of sending ACK_MP frames.\" \r\n\r\nThere are two issues with that. First, as stated, this text is just implementation guidance: the second sentence in fact says that ACK_MP can be sent on any path, and that nodes MUST not treat receiving an ACK_MP on a \"different\" path as an error. If this is implementation guidance, the text should move from the normative section to the implementation guidance section.\r\n\r\nSecond, I believe the guidance is wrong. I understand that the \"same path\" practice makes path RTT computation easier, but that's only one aspect of the issue, IMHO not the most dominant aspect. In QUIC, most packet losses are detected by noticing that packets sent later on the path are already acknowledged, not by waiting on timers. Sending ACK_MP on a short path will enable faster detection of packet losses by acked number holes, while sending only on the \"same\" path only improve the computation of RTT, which may or may not improve timer-based recovery. So, this is a trade-off: more precise path-RTT computation versus shorter control loop. Such tradeoff belong to implementation guidance, not the normative part.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I contributed the algorithm used in Picoquic to derive path estimates through multi-dimensional statistical analysis. OK, I get the criticism that we should not require every implementer to have a PhD in applied maths. There are of course much simpler ways to do this. Suppose a packet is sent on path X and the ACK received on path Y. The RTT will be approximately 1/2 the RTT of path X plus 1/2 the RTT of path Y. If we assume that delay variations are dominated by effects on the send path, we can apply a simple transform:\r\n\r\n1- let S be an RTT sample with data transmission on path X and ack on path Y.\r\n2- assume that S = 1/2 RTT(X) + 1/2 RTT(Y)\r\n3- derive S' = 2*S - RTT(Y)\r\n4- consider S' as an approximation of a measurement of RTT(X)\r\n5- use S' to update the smoothed RTT of path X, the RTT deviation, and the PTO.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss whether step 3 should use the smoothed RTT observed on path Y or the min RTT. Using the min RTT is probably more robust. The key here is that we can update the PTO of the path using very simple math.\r\n\r\nBut we can also wonder whether this is even needed. The PTO triggers when there is suspicion that the last packets sent to a path were lost. Effectively, the PTO triggers when \"at this time, an ACK_MP should have been received\". If ACK_MP are usually sent on the shortest path, it seems fine to just use the observed ACK delay (S in the example above) to update the PTO. The PTO will reflect both the delays and the ACK_MP sending strategy of the peer, and will fire exactly when the ACK_MP of the peer should most probably have been received.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the value could end up being wrong -- but that's not a new issue. The statistical model behind the PTO computation in RFC 9002 is an approximation (see \"no PhD\" comment), and that too is wrong some of the time. That's why RFC 9002 specifies doubling the PTO delay after each trial, and also not changing congestion parameter simply because of a first PTO expiration.\r\n\r\nBottom line: mandating ACK_MP on the same path is a tradeoff between ease of path RTT computation and efficiency of loss recovery. It should not be mandated. If we want to provide guidance, that should be in the implementation section.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For example, even alternating paths on every ACK produces RTT and RTTVar values that should not cause spurious PTOs, because the RTT will be the mean RTT and the farther apart the RTTs are, the larger the RTTVar will be.\r\n\r\nLooking at RFC9002, there are a number of normative statements about RTT calculation, and some of those were added to minimize the possibility of spurious PTOs, but there's nothing that parallels this I can find, so I could go either way on normative text.\r\n\r\nOne reason to send an ACK on the same path that data is received upon is to ensure network devices (ie: NATs, etc) keep the path open.

Quoting from [section 9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#name-privacy-implications-of-con), _an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending from more than one local address_, and _an endpoint MUST NOT reuse a connection ID when sending to more than one destination address_. To paraphrase, when sending to a new 4-tuple, a previously unused Connection ID has to be available.\r\n\r\n> Also maybe we want to say more on the fact that active_connection_id_limit limits the number of active paths. So I guess you should check that parameter at least against the number of already open paths.\r\n\r\nYeah, availability of spare Connection IDs limits the number of paths that can be opened, while `active_connection_id_limit` gives endpoints the expectation. I think the discussion of the expectation is covered by #221?\r\n\r\n> And finally an endpoint might also check the number of active paths again the number of active CID it provided to the peer. If all CIDs appear to be used by active paths and that number of provided values is be below active_connection_id_limit, it should sent a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame before initiating validation.\r\n\r\nThat is already covered by [RFC 9000 section 8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-8.2-7), I think. Of course, I would not be opposed to adding a reference from the Multipath document, but considering that we are reusing the path establishment process of RFC 9000 maybe we do not need to repeat the point.",

      "body": "We introduced the idle timeout in RFC 9000 to enable endpoints to close idle connections without sending any packets (and potentially powering up the radio for that). Idle timeouts are inherently racy: the start time will vary slightly between both endpoints (by about half an RTT), and a packet sent just before expiration of the idle timeout period might be received just after the expiration.\r\nThis is ok because running into the idle timeout will completely free up all resources associated with that connection, and stray packets will elicit stateless resets, allowing the other node to do the same.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I fully understand how this applies to paths. It seems like there needs to be a clear signal that a path has been abandoned due to idleness. Sending this signal will be very cheap if it\u2019s bundled with frames that would be sent anyway on a different path.\r\n\r\nThat said, I\u2019m wondering if the idle timeout is really the right concept for paths to begin with. Peers usually apply some kind of keep-alive logic to keep a path alive, and that keep-alive period is based on the (presumed) characteristics of the path, such as the (presumed) timeouts applied by NATs, as well as the cost of sending a packet on that particular path. Would it make sense to introduce the concept of a path timeout, which could be attached to the PATH_ frames?",

      "body": "The current version of the draft introduces a very tight coupling between paths and connection IDs. This feels unnatural, since QUIC was designed such that CIDs can be rotated (potentially very) frequently, even in the absence of any path migration / probing.\r\n\r\nThe tight coupling in this draft leads to a whole range of problems:\r\n1. It complicates path state management. The CID used to establish a path might be retired, and a different CID may be used on that path. I'm struggling to figure out which sequence number to send in PATH_STATUS frames in this case. There's the risk that PATH_* frames can't be associated with a (still existing!) path because the CID was retired.\r\n2. When initiating a new path, there's a requirement to check that 1. the endpoint itself has a CID available for that path and 2. the peer also has a CID available. Note that this inherently racy: The peer might just have started using that CID on a different path.\r\n3. Loss recovery: As the packet number is reset to 0 when switching to a new CID. On the wire, this means that packets received on the same path now need to be acknowledged in separate ACK_MP frames. Implementations would now put a lot of effort into running loss recovery across the multiple packet number spaces belonging to the same path.\r\n\r\nI believe the design would become significantly easier if CIDs were scoped to the path to begin with:\r\n* This would mean adding a Path ID varint to the existing NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame (or alternatively, deprecating NEW_CONNECTION_ID in favor of a new MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame). Same for the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame. Sequence numbers for CIDs would now be incremented per path (i.e. any path would start with CID number 0).\r\n* The `active_connection_id_limit` transport parameter could be reinterpreted to mean the maximum number of active connection IDs _per path_. It could be accompanied by a `active_path_limit` transport parameter to allow the client to limit the number of paths.\r\n\r\nI believe this would resolve the problems described above. In addition, this has a few nice properties:\r\n1. The server would explicitly limit how many paths it is willing to accept. Credit for additional paths could be granted over the lifetime of the connection by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID with new path IDs.\r\n2. The utility of the \"Retire Prior To\" field of the RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame would be restored: \"Retire Prior To\" would only apply to CIDs issued on that particular path.\r\n3. A neat implementation strategy on the client side would be to bundle a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame for the new path in the packet containing the PATH_CHALLENGE frame. Maybe we could even introduce a protocol requirement that a client MUST NOT issue connection IDs for unused paths?\r\n4. It would simplify CID management when paths are retired: Just remove all CIDs associated with a path when (or shortly after) it's retired.\r\n\r\nIt has not escaped my attention that this proposal suggests another strategy for key management, which - among others - would simplify the key update problem. I'll follow up in a separate issue.",

You never know when a NAT rebinding takes places, and that introduces lots of complexity when trying to use a \"hard\" notion of path identifiers.\r\n\r\nOn path management: yes, there is a tie between life of a CID and life of the associated number space.

In my mental model, a NAT rebinding doesn't open a new path (although it might require re-verification of the path as described in RFC 9000, Section 9). The client has no way of know when a NAT rebinding will happen / has happened, so it won't be able to anything about it: It will just continue sending with the old CID. That old CID would still be bound to the old Path ID.\r\n\r\nIn my proposal, the _only_ thing that would open a new path is the client consciously making the decision to do so: by using a CID associated with a fresh Path ID (in the common case, on a new 4-tuple).\r\n\r\nActually, I'd consider it a nice property that the server can now distinguish between a NAT rebinding (path ID stays constant) and initiation of a new path (new path ID is used).\r\n\r\n> You do not actually need to tie multiple number spaces together for loss recovery: you can merely rely on timers after closing a number space.

In the current state, I looked at a notion of symmetric Path ID, given that paths must be bidirectional per RFC9000. Overall, I agree with all the properties in the initial message, and note some additional properties.\r\n\r\nA nice part of this proposal is that it decouples the notion of \"network paths\" (i.e., the 4-tuple, having some validation state,...) from \"logical QUIC paths\" and \"application packet number spaces\" (i.e., acknowledgments, number of concurrent active paths, recovery states, active/standby status,...). Advertising in advance using MP_CONNECTION_ID frames to which \"Path ID\" the provided CID simplifies the \"path handling\" when the CID used over a same 4-tuple changes (as they belong to the same packet number space, unlike the current state of the draft).\r\n\r\nAnother nice property relates to the \"connection migration\". The current draft \"overrides\" the handling defined by RFC9000 to let the server use any available network path. This means that if a client probes an network path just to check possible connectivity, it opens the door to that network path usage by the server, which may not always be wanted (the client can still advertise a Standby status over that path with PATH_STATUS/PATH_STANDBY, but this is only a scheduling suggestion, the client has no way to enforce this at server-side). With the Path ID proposal, the connection migration mechanism remains on a per-Path ID basis, enabling clients to probe a network path (using probing packets) without having the server moving the traffic towards that probed network path.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, basing the \u201cpath abandon\u201d mechanism on such Path ID sounds more robust than identifying paths through CIDs. A \u201cPATH_CLOSE\u201d frame could be defined and would force retiring all the CIDs associated to that Path ID and hence control the number of simultaneous network paths in use for non-probing packets. For the advertisement of status of the paths, they would also remain explicit, even if the CID used over a path changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, using Path IDs would enable per-path keys, though as a first step we could stay with the current nonce adaptation and includes the Path ID in the nonce instead of the CID sequence number.\r\n\r\nOf course, this introduces some additional wiring (MP_NEW_CONNECTION_ID and MP_RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames, the active_path_limit TP that must be advertised by both peers) and the multipath extension would be \"less minimal\".

When talking about diversion from RFC 9000, I'm surprised adding a new frame type is considered a big diff. It's really easy to build a frame parser, and we're not going to run out of frame types any time soon. Deviating from the design principles of RFC 9000 on the other hand can create an enormous amount of complexity.\r\n\r\nI agree that (1) and (3) would go away _iff_ you never rotate CIDs on an existing path. While rotating CIDs can be seen as an anti-ossification measure, I think I remember that @nibanks is using Retire Prior To field in the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with his RSS implementation in MsQuic.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this feature of RFC 9000 is effectively rendered useless, unless one wants to risk running into the corner cases described in section 4.3.3 around having established paths that don't have an associated CID (and therefore can't be addressed by PATH_* frames). I haven't implemented it yet in quic-go, but I imagine that this corner case would be rather annoying to deal with.\r\n\r\n(3) introduces a very big diff to RFC 9000: Loss recovery for the two packet number spaces created by rotating the CID on a path seems pretty complicated: You'd now either have to declare the packet sent with the old CID lost if it's not acknowledged, or implement loss recovery that spans the two packet number spaces. It's probably doable, but it's not trivial. It's also fundamentally different from QUIC v1, where rotating a CID on an existing path doesn't create a new packet number space.\r\n\r\n> * The need to prepare for having state of max(active_paths) * max(1 + backups_for_each_path), rather than just max(active_connection_id_limit). IIUC, the proposal is to introduce the concept of Path IDs with each of the path having spare Connection IDs that the peer might use.\r\n\r\nYou're right, you'd need to allocate a tiny bit more space for CIDs. I don't expect that there are many situations where you'd have more than 5 paths (that already seems quite a lot), and you don't need more than 2 or 3 CIDs per path, even if you want to allow for frequent rotation of CIDs. That's not a lot of state.",

But that does not happen frequently, I believe that is the same for others as well. Therefore, problem (1) is IMO not an issue in practice.\r\n\r\nNote that, in order to handle packets arriving late, an endpoint has to be capable for receiving packets with CIDs that it has issued in the past for at least 3 PTO. Therefore, even in the case of an endpoint rotating CIDs at full speed, there will be high chance of PATH_STATUS getting through.\r\n\r\nRe (3), when changing the CID of an existing path, all an endpoint needs to do is remember the delta (base offset) between the packet number sent on the wire and that being remembered by the loss recovery logic / congestion controller. To give an example, if an endpoint has sent using CID=X packets up to PN=1000, and wants to switch CID to Y, all it needs to remember is an offset of 1001. The first packet sent with CID=Y will carry PN=0, but internally, it would be handled as PN=1001 by adding the offset.\r\n\r\nThe remaining one is (2), but I do not consider that as an issue. In practice, a new CID is used when either of the following happens: i) a client tries to use a new path, ii) a server sends a packet to a new client address. To support these two cases, all that have to be done by the endpoints are provide as many as active_connection_id_limit CIDs, and by the clients to always keep one spare CID or two (see #221).\r\n\r\nNote that while QUIC v1 does not prohibit endpoints rotating CIDs for no reason, endpoints behaving as such risk themselves of losing CIDs, as [the peer might run out of CIDs and stop providing more](https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/rfc9000.html#section-5.1.1-6).\r\n\r\nPS.\r\n> You're right, you'd need to allocate a tiny bit more space for CIDs.\r\n\r\nThe amount of state that you need to retain depends on what you want to do e.g., in response to an apparent rebinding. As discussed in https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/50#issuecomment-1617086967, for a server, it makes sense to bundle data in a probe sent in response to an apparent rebinding. In a request-response protocol, doing so saves an RTT. But to do so, you need more state per CID not to mention the complexity of reusing CCs across multiple paths; things are much easier with current design that allows a server to start using a new new packet number space for a new path that _the server_ observes (rather than letting the proposed \"path ID\" approach that lets only the client designate packet spaces).",

This was also discussed at length in issue #169 \r\n\r\nWe need to address this case and that makes the explicit path ID approach complicated. Having an explicit path ID seems logical easier and for sure it make sense for the mental model, however, encoding it in the protocol design means actually additional complexity.\r\n\r\nRegarding your issue list @marten-seemann:\r\n\r\nNote that we need to resign PATH_STATUS anyway (see issue #186). However, first, PATH_STATUS is only a recommendation. If you don't have PATH_STATUS information about a used CID, that doesn't automatically mean that you should use it. So If you see a CID change on a path, I don't think this should automatically change your scheduling. The other option is in the loose path model that you could even send PATH_STATUS information for issued but not yet-used CIDs in advance and thereby per-set that information. Or if you could also send the PATH_STATUS frame in the packet with a new CID or even repeat it multiple times if you really want to be sure. Again, we need to redesign PATH_STATUS and we need to consider the issue you describe; this is a known issue that wasn't fully resolved with the last revision.\r\n\r\nYou second point is discussed in issue #205 and it is incorrect to have a MUST requirement for the availability of CIDs on the other end. This is something you can't guarantee but this is already the case in RFC9000. So I think it's rather an editorial issue to remove this requirement from the current draft.\r\n\r\nRegarding loss recovery, I think @huitema answer this point already. The expectation is that you do not do loss recovery between to packet number spaces. If the CID and therefore the packet number changes and a loss might happen in that RTT, then recovery might be slower as you have to wait for a time-out. However, that's such a rare case that I wouldn't recommend to optimise it because of the complexity you describe above.\r\n\r\n  ",

We do however gain some simplifications, some of them significant.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion we've had so far, I believe the following list summarizes the advantages we'd gain from adopting path IDs.\r\n\r\n1. By having one key per path (#215), the complexity around key updates described in section 5.3 (e.g. sending a packet _on every path_ after initiating a key update) would go away entirely. Key updates would instead be something that happens independently on each path, and there wouldn't be any need for special logic when using QUIC multipath.\r\n1. By deriving a separate key per path (#215) we could avoid changing the nonce construction specified in RFC 9001. Arguably, this alone is a simplification. While hypothetical at the moment (in my understanding), with #245, this extension now introduces new constraints on the cipher suites that can be used with QUIC Multipath. It would certainly be nice if any cipher suite that can be used with RFC 9001 could also be used with QUIC Multipath.\r\n1. It allows explicitly limiting the number of paths. There's a significant amount of state that peers need to keep track of per path, and being able to limit the number of paths is a nice DoS defense. By using path IDs, this limit can be stricter than just limiting the number of CIDs, as currently CIDs can be used on an established path (cheap in terms of state) and to establish a new path (expensive). This comes at the cost of having to issue a few more CIDs, as @kazuho pointed out above, but the memory commitment should be negligible.\r\n1. Packet numbers are now per path, not per CID.

Ericsson's in-house MP-QUIC implementation, called Rask, is designed from start for multipath. One of the most important things when structuring the stack is to clearly define what is per-path and what is at the common connection level, and I think that Marten has hit it more or less spot on! The path \"concept\" also needs to be well defined, and the path \"identity\" (with a single identifier) should be stable and easy to reason about also through NAT rebindings and CID updates--just like in Marten's design.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think that it's trivial to add new frame types and it is *much* better to be explicit in signalling than to add new, different semantics to existing frames with the misdirected argumentation that it would \"reduce the difference with RFC 9000\".\r\n\r\nI have had plans to add support for Marten's design to Rask, but didn't come around to do it partially due to the lack of another implementation to interop test with.

          "body": "@marten-seemann \r\n> 1. By having one key per path (\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/215), the complexity around key updates described in section 5.3 (e.g. sending a packet on every path after initiating a key update) would go away entirely. Key updates would instead be something that happens independently on each path, and there wouldn't be any need for special logic when using QUIC multipath.\r\n> 2. By deriving a separate key per path (\r\nhttps://github.com/quicwg/multipath/issues/215) we could avoid changing the nonce construction specified in RFC 9001. Arguably, this alone is a simplification. While hypothetical at the moment (in my understanding), with https://github.com/quicwg/multipath/pull/245, this extension now introduces new constraints on the cipher suites that can be used with QUIC Multipath. It would certainly be nice if any cipher suite that can be used with RFC 9001 could also be used with QUIC Multipath.\r\n\r\nI think point 1 (key update) and 2 (key derivation) are orthogonal to having Path IDs. We can change the current draft to derive keys per-CID and update keys per each path, if we think that\u2019s beneficial. But as @huitema points out, probably they are just cost that we want to avoid.\r\n\r\nI would also note that the key update problem has been fixed in #257 by changing the minimum update interval from 3PTO to 3maxPTO; I think that\u2019s simple enough as a fix.\r\n\r\n> 3. It allows explicitly limiting the number of paths. There's a significant amount of state that peers need to keep track of per path, and being able to limit the number of paths is a nice DoS defense. By using path IDs, this limit can be stricter than just limiting the number of CIDs, as currently CIDs can be used on an established path (cheap in terms of state) and to establish a new path (expensive). This comes at the cost of having to issue a few more CIDs, as @kazuho pointed out above, but the memory commitment should be negligible.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure if I agree with what is being stated. With the current design, it is true that endpoints have to retain CIDs (and hence loss recovery and congestion control state) for some paths that act as standby. However, I do not think it mean that endpoints have to retain meaningfully more state than with the proposed design. It is my understanding that the amount of state an endpoint needs to track relates much more to the amount of data inflight (i.e., number of packets that needs to be tracked) rather than the number of paths being maintained.\r\n\r\n> 4. Packet numbers are now per path, not per CID. This makes rotating CIDs on a given path easier, as you can reuse the same loss detection / recovery context. There's some tricks (as pointed out by @kazuho and @huitema in this thread) to achieve the same effect with the current proposal, and one can disagree about the amount of complexity these would introduce. It would be nice though to not have to play any tricks at all.\r\n\r\nThis is true.\r\n\r\n> 5. We would restore the utility of \"Retire Prior To\" in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames. Retire Prior To is most commonly used when the (load balancing) key is rotated. With the current proposal, it retires the CIDs used on (potentially) multiple paths, leaving paths without CIDs until a new CID is issued and used on the path. Retiring all CIDs for an existing path leads to the awkward corner case described in section 4.3.3 (note that this can also happen when using RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames). While path IDs won't prevent peers from retiring all CIDs for an existing path (and thereby making it impossible to send new packets on that path), you'd at least still be able to address that path (in frames sent on other paths), since you're referring to the path by its path ID.\r\n\r\nWhen an endpoint retires a set of CIDs, it is expected to issue a set of new CIDs that replace the old ones. That is the behavior expected by QUIC version 1, I do not think we have new information here to switch to a new design, considering the fact that QUIC version 1 has the capability of opening multiple paths and hence using multiple Connection IDs at once.\r\n\r\nThe difference (and the practical benefit of this \u201cPath ID\u201d proposal) are, IMO:\r\n* when Connection IDs are rotated, path status does not have to be communicated, and\r\n* when Connection IDs are rotated, you do not need the \u201ctrick\u201d (of transplanting loss recovery / congestion control state of the old CID to the new CID).\r\n\r\nThese are indeed benefits, but my impression is that it comes with the cost of changing the data structure from what QUIC version 1 expected for the stacks to have.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC version 1, an endpoint retains `active_connection_id_limit` paths, but all the state required for transmitting data (i.e., packet number space, ack queue, loss recovery, congestion control) are shared. The fact that these properties are shared across entire connection limits us to having only one active path at a time.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of Multipath draft makes these properties as per-path attributes, which is probably the minimal change that we have to make.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed change, however, path management is split into two layers.\r\n\r\nEach connection will have N \u201cpath\u201ds, each of them identified by their Path IDs. Within each \u201cpath,\u201d there will be actual paths as identified by the 4-tuple. When NAT rebind happens, it would be a migration within the \u201cpath\u201d as identified by the \u201cpath ID.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase, essentially each \u201cpath ID\u201d space has its own path migration scheme, and a Multipath connection will consolidate these \u201cpaths\u201d (or sub-connections) so that data can be sent on more than one path concurrently.\r\n\r\nI can totally see that for some endpoints such design is easier to implement. I appreciate @michael-eriksson for bringing such experience to the table.\r\n\r\nBut for me, it would be a pain to support different types of data structures for QUIC version 1 (that directly maps paths as identified by 4-tuple to each connection) and Multipath (that will have connections mapped to \u201cpath IDs\u201d then each \u201cpath\u201d managing a set of 4-tuples).\r\n\r\n> 6. Abandoning a path currently means sending a PATH_ABANDON frame, and waiting for the retirement of the CID used on that path. Using path IDs would allow us to clean up all CIDs associated with that path.\r\n\r\nI think this problem statement is true.\r\n\r\n\u2028OTOH, for the sake of the Path ID proposal, I do not think we need the capability to issue / retire Path IDs? All we need to say is that if an endpoint declares that it is capable of handing N paths, path IDs between 0 to N - 1 are to be used.\r\n\r\nFor QUIC streams we do have such mechanism for issuing / retiring IDs, but that\u2019s because they are communicated above the packetization layer. Path IDs are concept at the packetization layer, reusing the same path ID on a different 4-tuple is no worse than a NAT rebinding.\r\n\r\nIf we are to adopt the Path ID proposal, I would prefer not having the complexity of issuing / retiring Path IDs.",

When there\u2019s a change in the 4-tuple, we simply rotate the Connection IDs (CIDs) and shift the packet number space. As outlined in RFC 9002, loss recovery can be done on a per-packet-number-space basis. It\u2019s also important to recognize that events like NAT rebindings and CID rotations are infrequent events in real-world scenarios.

And then, since the packet numbers are encrypted, the middleboxes have no basis to perform any reordering.

Packet replication over diverse paths is a common technique for applications requiring high(er) reliability and low(er) latency. In this case, replication of the QUIC packet occurs after encryption so they are, in fact, exact copies. The different copies would be encapsulated in different IP/UDP datagrams associated with different sockets, corresponding to the different paths established (using MPQUIC) between the client and the PEF.\r\n\r\nA single packet number space would greatly simplify implementation.",

Yet, if you assign CIDs to specific paths, this creates an extra dependency, necessitating extra information exchange on the initial path before a new one can be launched.

You should open a specific issue with your suggestion.\r\n\r\n@huitema: I'm not sure it's so easy to separate the issues.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, there are two models for multi-path operations: model (A) is a collection of uni-path QUIC constructs while model (B) is a uni-path QUIC construct operating over a collection of paths.\r\n\r\nModel (A) is like MPTCP and appears to be the model of the current MPQUIC design. Model (B) is like a TCP connection operating over a layer 2 link aggregation group. In (B), a TCP segment can be transmitted in an IP datagram over any of the links in the LAG.\r\n\r\nIf we apply (B) principles to MPQUIC, then path management is distinct from connection management. Conceptually the MPQUIC stack is an RFC 9000 entity sitting on top of a path management entity with a shim entity between them to direct a QUIC packet over one of the available paths.\r\n\r\nIn (B), a QUIC packet can be sent over any of the available (and unrestricted) paths. Since connection identifiers are independent of path, a QUIC packet received over any path is processed in the same way as a packet received over the single path construct of RFC 9000 - i.e. there is a single application data packet number space and an ACK received over any path is unambiguous (no need for MP-ACK).\r\n\r\nThese are basically the principles used for connection migration in RFC 9000. The difference is that MPQUIC provides multiple paths that can be simultaneously active and path usage is explicitly managed. Clearly congestion control must be path-specific but connection management and packet loss recovery are not path-specific.\r\n\r\nIn this model, it is hard to imagine a solution that does not include an explicit path identifier that is independent of connection identifiers.",

From my current understanding,\r\n\r\n> If paths have a status, what is the default status of a path just after validation, and before receiving any Status frame?\r\n\r\nAs long as no status information is received, I would consider a path as being \"available\" for use.\r\n\r\n> Who send this? From the draft, I think \"either endpoint\". But then, what does that mean if one endpoint says \"available\" and the other says \"standby\"?\r\n\r\nThat's a good point. I see use cases from a client-sending perspective, but I don't see why a server could not send statuses as well. The PATH_STATUS frame gives an indication about what should be its peer's path scheduling strategy, but it has no way of forcing the other to do so...\r\n\r\n> If a path is standby state and the endpoint receives validating frames on that path, does the status change?\r\n\r\nI would decouple the validation state of a network path from its status usage. In other words, I would not use implicit signals to change the (usage) status requested by the peer over a path.\r\n\r\n> If a path is in standby state and no other path is in available state, does the standby path automatically become available?\r\n\r\nI would say that if your peer advertises the path as being standby, you SHOULD not use it for non-probing packets, unless there is no working available paths. The concrete implementation of such a behaviour is implementation-specific, as this is a scheduling issue (starting from when do you consider that a path is not working anymore? if it experiences RTOs or being abandoned/closed?). Furthermore, in the case you have several standby paths (and no available ones), it is up to the endpoint to decide which path(s) to use (until receiving explicit signals).\r\n\r\n> Do we really need to maintain a sequence counter for status frames per path and per direction?\r\n\r\nFor sending, I think you could use a single counter for all paths and directions, if wanted. But at receiving side, each path needs to track the highest sequence number that updated its status, to cope with reordered receive patterns. For instance, if you have p1 being standby by the seq being 19, and p2 being available, updated by seq 18, and the receive frames in the following order:\r\n\r\n- Status (p1, seq=22, available) : highest seq on p1, update p1 to available\r\n- Status (p2, seq=21, standby): highest seq on p2, update p2 to standby\r\n- Status (p1, seq=20, standby): not the highest seq on p1, ignore old information",

I see use cases from a client-sending perspective, but I don't see why a server could not send statuses as well. The PATH_STATUS frame gives an indication about what should be its peer's path scheduling strategy, but it has no way of forcing the other to do so...\r\n\r\nActually we say \"An endpoint uses PATH_STATUS frames to inform that the peer should send packets in the preference expressed by these frames.\"\r\n\r\nThat means it always the receiver that informs the sender. Note that as we don't have a path identified anymore the PATH_STATUS information in unidirectional and therefore it is possible that one peer says it okay to send on a certain path, while the other end does not what to receive anything on that same path.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > If a path is standby state and the endpoint receives validating frames on that path, does the status change?\r\n\r\nNo. The path status is only a recommendation but it doesn't forbid sending: \"PATH_STATUS frame to express a preference in path usage\". However, I guess that not fully clear in the frame definition section as we use normative SHOULDs there. Seem like an editorial clarification could make sense.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I would decouple the validation state of a network path from its status usage. In other words, I would not use implicit signals to change the (usage) status requested by the peer over a path.\r\n> \r\n> > If a path is in standby state and no other path is in available state, does the standby path automatically become available?\r\n\r\nNo. But it can be used as it is just a recommendation. See also discussion in issue #238.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I would say that if your peer advertises the path as being standby, you SHOULD not use it for non-probing packets, unless there is no working available paths. The concrete implementation of such a behaviour is implementation-specific, as this is a scheduling issue (starting from when do you consider that a path is not working anymore? if it experiences RTOs or being abandoned/closed?). Furthermore, in the case you have several standby paths (and no available ones), it is up to the endpoint to decide which path(s) to use (until receiving explicit signals).\r\n> \r\n> > Do we really need to maintain a sequence counter for status frames per path and per direction?\r\n\r\nThe sequence number is per connection but you have to hold state per path anyway as Quentin described below.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> For sending, I think you could use a single counter for all paths and directions, if wanted. But at receiving side, each path needs to track the highest sequence number that updated its status, to cope with reordered receive patterns. For instance, if you have p1 being standby by the seq being 19, and p2 being available, updated by seq 18, and the receive frames in the following order:\r\n> \r\n> * Status (p1, seq=22, available) : highest seq on p1, update p1 to available\r\n> * Status (p2, seq=21, standby): highest seq on p2, update p2 to standby\r\n> * Status (p1, seq=20, standby): not the highest seq on p1, ignore old information\r\n\r\nDo we now need any text updates @huitema ?",

Without such information, the sender cannot determine if it should retransmit when a packet is deemed lost; the receiver cannot determine if the received frame contains the newest information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by defining the sequence number as per-connection, the specification is requiring the sender to retain another state which is the per-connection sequence number. If we change the sequence number to be per-DCID, we do not need such state.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, using a per-DCID sequence number is more natural (because each state being sent will have it's own sequence number) and requires less state.",

There are cases where it makes sense to send acknowledgements on a path other than on which you receive packets. For example, when receiving a packet via a cellular network, it could make sense to send ACK_MP frames through Wifi, as the latter has lower latency in general.

After receiving packets from the client on a new path, if the server decides to use the new path, the server MUST perform path validation ([Section 8.2](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-8.2) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)]) unless it has previously validated that address.[\u00b6](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-4.1-3)\r\n\r\nIf validation succeed, the client can send non-probing, 1-RTT packets on the new paths. In contrast with the specification in [Section 9](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-9) of [[QUIC-TRANSPORT](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#QUIC-TRANSPORT)], the server MUST NOT assume that receiving non-probing packets on a new path indicates an attempt to migrate to that path.

However, if you have a concrete use case why you need to send application/non-probably data on a new path before address validation is concluded, please describe that use case in more details.

The server will verify that the source IP address of the incoming client-hello matches the source address programmed in the token. But the NEW_TOKEN frame does not convey that IP address. The client implementations have to guess which of their IP address that is. In RFC9000 implementations, the client will typically assume that the token is linked to the IP address used during the handshake. \r\n\r\nThe tempting solution is to defined a \"better\" new token frame that carries the IP address verified by the server, but I would rather not try to define that as part of the multipath extension. The issue also arise in basic RFC9000 after NAT rebinding or after path migration, which indicates we would be better of with a focused \"better new token\" extension, independent of multipath.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned that doing this \"better new token\" correctly assumes that the client knows which IP address it is using. For clients behind NAT, that's not obvious. Adding ways to learn that smells a lot like dipping into peer-to-peer support, which definitely seems out of scope for the multipath draft.\r\n\r\nFor now, we might simply note the issue and that the token is tied to the client IP address used during the handshake.

If an endpoint receives a Destination Connection ID sequence number greater than any previously sent to the peer, it MUST treat this as a connection error of type MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.\r\n\r\nThis one doesn't seem as easy as the first. However, the endpoint that receives the bogus frame can just indicate the frame type in the CONNECTION_CLOSE. It might also say something in the reason phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn balance, it feels to me that dropping MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION would not make anyone's lives too hard, while saving the overhead of defining and implementing the error code.",

The PATH_ABANDON frame therefore recommends to the receiver that no packets should be sent on that path anymore.\r\n\r\nThis means that PATH_ABANDON frame like **abort_reading** for the sender side, just like the RESET_STREAM frame does on the quic stream layer.\r\n\r\nAnd described in [6.2. ](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#section-6.2)[Path Closure](https://quicwg.org/multipath/draft-ietf-quic-multipath.html#name-path-closure)\r\n\r\n> In this example, the client detects the network environment change (client's 4G/Wi-Fi is turned off, Wi-Fi signal is fading to a threshold, or the quality of RTT or loss rate is becoming worse) and wants to close the initial path.\r\n\r\nFor a specific 4-tuple, the sending and receiving paths of packets are not alway the same.  \r\nIn the scenario of HTTP file download, **the server can better understand the quality of  RTT or loss rate.**  So do we allow the server to **actively** stop sending and notify the peer?  \r\n\r\nMaybe a special frame similar to the STOP_SENDING frame is needed in multi-path quic?\r\n",

From a server perspective, a path object can be identified by the cid generated by the client, and the path object don't care about the source address.\r\n\r\nYour problem there was a confusion of path definition with path identification. For path definition, you need 4-tuple. Otherwise, there is going to be the ambiguity issue as Christian just mentioned.  When you have path established, you can surely identify a path using cid, which is also specified in the draft.",

In other words, an XPATH consists of multiple paths, but only one of them is used for transmitting non-probing packets. The simultaneous transmission of non-probing frames on multiple **XPATH**s is allowed in an MPQUIC connection.\r\n* Require the use of non-zero Connection IDs in both directions. An endpoint MUST use different Connection IDs on different **XPATH**s. If the 4-tuple changes without the use of a new connection ID (e.g. due to a NAT rebinding), this is considered as a migration event.\r\n* Use the ACK frame to acknowledge the received packets, which should be sent on the same **XPATH**.

However, as each CID has its own PNS, this makes implementing MPQUIC more complicated and leads to sub-optimal performance in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples (Figure-1 & Figure-2), when NAT-rebinding happens on path-1, we have to create new PNSs that are associated with new CIDs,  associate the new PNSs with path-1, and simultaneously maintain both the old and new PNSs for some time (the old PNSs should not be released immediately for performance consideration as there could be unacked/inflight pkts). \r\n\r\nEven worse, if the client rotates the CID of path-1 after an idle period and NAT rebinding happens simultaneously, path-1 will experience a long timeout and be closed (Figure-3). If the client wants to resume the transmission on path-1, it has to reopen it.\r\n\r\nThe above issues are solved if we disable CID rotation on opened paths (Figure-4, Figure-5, and Figure-6): 1. No need to do the complicated management of multiple PNSs for each path; 2. CID rotation and NAT rebinding will never happen at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis actually simplifies the implementation of MPQUIC in practice.

But the Path Standby frame or Path Available can be delayed for some time, for example in case of loss recovery. In that interval, the server will follow its default sending policy, which may not be what the client wants.\r\n\r\nI think this is solved nicely if we keep the old validation process of RFC 9000 as the default.

This interval is different from that of QUIC version 1 which used three times the PTO of the only one active path.`\r\n\r\nAfter having done some testing with key update in our implementations with different length paths some conclusions have been drawn.\r\n\r\nFirst is that it difficult for an endpoint to know when an old key can safely be dropped. With multiple path being possible to send on, and not necessarily used as well as to send ACKs on. Thus the fact that one get key phase back as a responder indicate that beyond on-path reordering things should be settled. But for multipath one can conclude for paths being used that key-phase changes have happened. But for path currently not receiving any packet one don't know if they are just being significantly delayed or may never have been sent. Also the path RTT samples one have might not be relevant for the current path delay. Thus, beyond observing that one get some key-phase change back, and starting a really long timer it is not obvious that you can generate an algorithm that enables one to know that no outstanding old keys are there. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this time needs to be longer than worst case RTT changes on each path do result that using 3*PTO is likely to short to re-enable key-update. At least unless one want to require trial decryption of the packets. This as keeping the old key while using the current key, so when one see a key-phase different one can try if it is the old key, if that fails and the next key works, then one drop the old key, and from that point assume this key-phase will be the new key. And thus initiating a key_update. \r\n\r\n",

      "body": "The debate over whether to use a stable path ID #214  may have deeper logical underpinnings than initially perceived and hinge on whether there\u2019s an agreed-upon definition of a path. \r\n\r\nThe current draft considers defining a path as a 4-tuple between two endpoints. This definition currently shapes the draft design, where different 4-tuples are assigned unique IDs and linked to distinct packet number spaces, maintaining logical consistency as this definition alone does not incorporate the concept of path \"**continuity**\".\r\n\r\nThose with differing views (i.e., stable path ID) essentially contest this definition of a path, perhaps even unknowingly. To adopt a stable path ID, we must redefine what constitutes a path, incorporating the idea of \u201c**continuity**.\u201d \r\n\r\nBut defining continuity is challenging. It suggests creating a transition graph where paths sharing an ID can trace back to a common origin, illustrated by transitions like`A1 -----> A2 ------> A3\r\n`, where `A` is some observable attributes of a path.\r\n\r\nAn _imperfect_ example of such transition graph is based on the combination of CID and 4-tuple:\r\n`(CID0, tuple0) ----> (CID0, tuple1) -----> (CID1, tuple1)\r\n`. However, the first complexity arises when both CID and tuple change simultaneously, as in`(CID0, tuple0) ----????-----> (CID1, tuple1)\r\n`. Here, it\u2019s unclear if these represent the same or different paths, making it impossible to construct a definitive transition graph. The second issue is that forcefully linking two such nodes with a path ID could lead to anomalies. For instance when we tie CID to path ID #214, you might start on an LTE path (PathID1) and have a standby path on Wi-Fi (PathID2) in a restaurant. Moving to a shopping mall and connecting to its Wi-Fi, you initially use a CID associated with PathID2. Yet, even after a CID rotation post path validation, you remain linked to PathID2 because you would rotate to another CID assigned for that PathID, despite the Wi-Fi path, its ISP, and the MTU potentially being different. There is another proposal of sticking to the loose path ID model but allowing the use of the same packet number space, again the logic hinges on whether we have a well-defined **continuity** to build a definitive transition so that we can link two paths to the same packet number space with no ambiguity.\r\n\r\nGiven the years of back-and-forth on this issue, it seems helpful to first reach a consensus on the path definition. The design should logically follow from this agreed definition, similar to how different assumptions about parallel lines underpin Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries. Without a clear definition, when we say \"This is the same path because it has the same identifier\", we are potentially entering a circular reasoning zone and we should avoid logical fallacy like that.\r\n\r\nI could be wrong, but I think if we want to have a test of time design, we need to address the path definition unequivocally. Therefore, I would suggest to call for a consensus on a formal path definition. Two questions: (1) Do we like to incorporate \"**continuity**\" in the definition or stick to the current 4-tuple definition? (2) How to come up with a formal definition to incorporate the idea of **continuity** in path definition?",

          "body": "Some clarity would be good. \r\n\r\nThe mechanism that I do understand is the numbering space. It is a tool that we use to number packets sent over one of the possible 4 tuples between two endpoints. This is important for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* numbering space is tied to loss recovery. Loss recovery becomes less effective in presence of out of order delivery. Loss recovery works well if all packets numbered from the same space arrive in order. Sender try to ensure that by sending packets from a given number space on the same four tuple. This is imperfect, because of NAT, but it is also the best that senders can do.\r\n* numbering space is tied to encryption, which require a unique nonce. This works well if we combine the packet number and the identifier of the numbering space in the nonce.\r\n* when receiving a packet, the receiver must use the same nonce as the sender. The receiver needs to identify the number space and the packet number from the packet header. The receiver cannot solely rely on the four tuple, because of NAT. The only element that the receiver can use is the connection ID.\r\n\r\nSo far, this means selecting a number space and one or several packet IDs to send on a given four tuple. Two designs can work: 1-1 mapping between connection ID and number space, or 1-N mapping, in which several connection ID point to the same number space.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, we do not require any tie between the two directions of communications. The tying happens because if the client starts sending using a 4 tuple, the server may decide to send using the symmetric 4 tuple. The server discovers a possible \"sending path\" by receiving packets from the client. Thus, a bit of complexity:\r\n\r\n* the client may want to control how the server uses this path. This is the role of the Path Available, Path Standby and Path Abandon frames. \r\n* the mapping between number space and 4-tuple will occasionally change, because of NAT. If the server derived a 4 tuple from packets received from the client, it needs to change that 4 tuple if it detects a NAT rebinding. There will necessarily be a period of uncertainty during which client and server don't have quite the same notion of 4-tuples.\r\n* the endpoints must be able to change the connection ID associated with a four tuple for privacy reasons, and also because connection IDs may have a limited lifetime.\r\n* the endpoints need to somehow agree to free the resource linked to a number space when it is not in use.\r\n\r\nThe \"1-1 mapping between CID and number space ID\" solves these requirements, but does induce a discontinuity in packet number when a connection ID is rotated. \r\n\r\nThe \"1-N mapping between number space and CID\" can also solve these issues. It does make CID rotation easy to handle, including when CID rotation is combined with NAT rebinding. The mapping does require some additional code for handling the 1-N mapping, such as for example a new \"new CID\" frame that links a CID to a path identifier. \r\n\r\nThe 1-N mapping also requires extra care when abandoning a path and freeing the resource, because just retiring a CID does not retire the number space. For example, does abandoning a number space automatically induce retiring the CID tied to that number space? How to handle arrival of packets for a CID that is not retired yet, but is tied to a retired number space?\r\n\r\nBack to @yfmascgy question: I think we get much clarity if we focus on number spaces instead of focusing on the actual definition of a path. I also think that we should be very explcit with our handling of Path directions. For the MP ACK, this is simple: the number space identifier is that used by the sender of the packets being acknowledged. For the Path Abandon, this is less clear. Is the statement \"I will not send anything more using that number space\" (i.e., local sender space ID), or \"Please don't send anything anymore with that number space\" (i.e., remote sender space ID)?\r\n",

With the existence of middleboxes between QUIC endpoints, the thing that defines a \"path\" may be different from the perspective of the different endpoints - e.g. the source IP address and UDP port that is inserted into an IP datagram by a sender may not be that same as the source IP address and UDP port seen in the the IP datagram by the receiver. And, as RFC9000 took pains to describe, the source IP address and UDP port seen in the the IP datagram by the receiver may change over time without the knowledge of the sender, resulting in (passive) connection migration.\r\n\r\nWithout the use of a path identifier that is independent of the 4-tuple, it is hard to see how the endpoints can have any meaningful dialogue regarding \"paths\". Some would argue that this independent path identifier should be a connection identifier, others would argue that it should be an explicit path identifier selected by an endpoint.\r\n\r\nIt might be worthwhile to look at the events that might result in the declaration of a new path. I don't think a receiver can unilaterally declare a new path based only on the detection of a passive connection migration (i.e. a change in the source IP address and/or UDP port seen in the a IP datagram).\r\n\r\nA sender may determine that it is using a new path based on:\r\n\r\na) a change in the source IP address used by the sender, and/or\r\n\r\nb) a change in the network access point used by the sender.\r\n\r\nNote that (b) often results in (a) but there are some access networks where the same source IP address can be used across different access points.\r\n\r\nThere are some deployments where (a) and/or (b) are hidden from the peer endpoint by the intervening network. Therefore, the declaration of a new path can only be made by a sender.\r\n\r\n@huitema : As you might guess, I am not in favour of solutions that require multiple packet number spaces ;-)",

I will just note that since those earlier single-versus-multiple space discussions, the multiple space solution (in draft -06) has resulted in divergence from RFC9000 in some pretty fundamental ways. I will also note (as I did in #214) that those earlier discussions were not aware of the incompatibility that has come to light between draft -06 and the masque QUIC-aware UDP proxy draft. \r\n\r\nHandling diverse path characteristics within a single packet number space is a solvable problem even if it makes the implementation more complex.",

This definition currently shapes the draft design, where different 4-tuples are assigned unique IDs and linked to distinct packet number spaces, maintaining logical consistency as this definition alone does not incorporate the concept of path \"continuity\".\r\n> \r\n> Those with differing views (i.e., stable path ID) essentially contest this definition of a path, perhaps even unknowingly. To adopt a stable path ID, we must redefine what constitutes a path, incorporating the idea of \u201ccontinuity.\u201d\r\n\r\nI think we have consensus that path is something that is identified by the 4-tuple (or 5-, if we consider the address family).\r\n\r\nIn case of \"stable path ID,\" I think it is just the name that might be confusing; it is actually referring to a particular \"send slot\" belonging to a QUIC connection. If we are to adopt such a design, I think the way to proceed would be to rename \"stable path ID\" to something else, rather than going back to the definition of \"path.\"",

How can the server know which encryption context it should use? The same issue would also happen in the case of NAT rebinding. The server sees a new five tuple, does not know what encryption to apply.\r\n\r\nSo, the first request is to specialize this text to the case in which the client uses zero length CID but the server does not.\r\n\r\nEven in that case, using the five tuple is going to make client-side encryption offload significantly more complex. The offload engines will have to remember all the five tuples used in the connection, and the corresponding keys. This is a new requirement, and it may be difficult to meet by many implementations.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much simpler to accept the limitation: using multiple number spaces requires that both sides use non-null connection IDs.",

I had previously opened another issue about moving the text on RTT estimates from \"single space\" to a common section.",

The clarity part is a matter of taste; the subtle deviations need discussion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, to process. Since the DPRIVE WG has not adopted a fully GitHub based process, the preferred method for requesting changes is by having a discussion on the WG mailing list. If we did adopt a GitHub based process, we should probably first migrate this depot to an IETF managed account. Then, we should make clear that discussions should start by opening an issue, not a pull request. Issues allow presentation of the problem before text changes and the archival of those discussions, pull requests are not designed for that. They should come later, when the issue has outlined a consensus for change.",

We have two cases.\r\n\r\n1. 1 sent on B, 2 sent on A\r\n\r\nThere are two sub-cases here.\r\n\r\n- The receiver sends an ACK before having received 2. `ACK(largest=1)` contains the ACK delay relative to path B. Then it receives 2, and sends `ACK(largest=2)` with ACK delay relative to path A. In this case, we have ACK delay for both paths.\r\n\r\n- The receiver waited for 2 before sending its ACK. Then, the ACK delay of `ACK(largest=2)` relates to path A, and we don't have the host delay of path B.\r\n\r\n2. 1 sent on A, 2 sent on B\r\n\r\nWhile we still have the two sub-cases, they both lead to the same result: `ACK(largest=2, missing=1)` and `ACK(largest=2)` have their ACK delay relative to the host delay of path B and not to the path A.\r\n\r\nIn general, if the largest packet number has been sent on the lowest latency path, it will prevent the receiver from advertising the host delay of higher latency paths. Note that the \"ideal case\" (where both paths have estimates) only works if the sender does not transmit further packets on the fast path, in which case we fall into case 2. As the fast path will get its packets acknowledged quicker, the sender will likely send further packets on fast path first. It might still be possible to get host delay estimates of slower paths, but most of the ACK delays will relate to the fast one.",

The new text essentially adds \"do not send if no non-probing packet received or acknowledged over 3 RTT.\" At first sight it looks right, but there is a tension. Suppose that, as a receiver, I wish the sender would stop sending on a path. With the old rule, I can simply stop sending on that path. With the new rule, I would have to also stop acknowledging packets, even if those packets were received correctly. That's not natural, a tension between signalling path preference and creating artificial losses. All considered, I would rather keep the old text.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that if I am a receiver that wants to proactively cause a sender to stop sending, I should use the explicit way of sending a path abandon frame. The idle timeout handles the case when a receiver is unaware of a path change that leads to communication failure. If that is the purpose, as long as the receiver can receive packets in the sender-to-receiver direction and acknowledge on another path, it looks to me that we should still allow the sender to use that path. But I feel if we do that, we are diverging from the bidirectional nature of a path described in the draft, which worths more discussion.",

We want to say that receiving data in one direction proves that the receiving direction works, and receiving acknowledgements proves that the sending direction works. Stop sending should logically be tied to the sending direction. If packets sent on a path are not acked, then the node should stop sending because the path is probably broken. But isn't that already covered? \r\n\r\nI think the text mixes two issues: stop sending because the path is broken; and, stop sending because the peer would rather not use it anymore. The peer not sending \"non probing\" data on the path may be an indication that it does not want to use it anymore. Or it may be an indication that it has nothing to send right now. Which means the signal is ambiguous, and using ambiguous signals is a bad idea. I think we should come down to two simple ideas:\r\n\r\n* nodes should monitor the quality of paths. If packets sent on the path are not acked, that means the quality is bad and the path should probably not be used.\r\n* nodes that want they peer to stop using a specific path should signal it using \"abandon path\" frame.",

Therefore please note that this PR proposes to add this text to the respective section for single PNS considerations. We can add more text about general ECN but that shouldn't be much different from normal QUIC operation and would be a separate PR for a different section of the document.  \r\n\r\n> Yes, in the case of single number space, that does mean single counter for all paths, and that makes the signal harder to use in congestion control.\r\n\r\nI don't think \"harder to use\" is right. If multiple packets from different paths are ack'ed in the same frame it's simply impossible to assign the signal to one path. As you never should just ignore a congestion signal, the most conservative but probably only correct reaction is unfortunately to reduce your cwnd on all paths where packet got ack'ed. \r\n\r\n> just not use ECN, i.e., send all packets with ECN flags \"00\".\r\n\r\nYes, that is an option and I can add this. This was actually my first thought (see my reply in issue #87). However, for me that would be a strong argument against the single PNS solution. But then I thought that if the receiver would send separate ACKs per path that could also address the problem and keeping ACKs separated per path (at least if the sender sends blocks of PNs on each path) might be beneficial anyway. I think that also something that Ian had in mind.\r\n\r\n> use ECN on only some path, e.g., the one path on which most data is sent, mark packets on this path with ECT-0 or ECT-1, mark packets on the other paths as \"00\".\r\n\r\nThat means you could only see ECN on one path. I don't think this an appropriate solution and again would be reason for me to not go for the single PNS solution.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 on one path, ECT-1 on the other, and use some logic to attribute ECN counts to either ECT-0 or ECT-1.\r\n\r\nI think this is out of scope for this document as it makes a different use of ECT1 against the recommendation in RFC8311 (and in conflict with L4S). So if you want to propose this, you have to go to tsvwg.\r\n\r\n> use ECT-0 or ECT-1 on all paths, and use correlation with other factors (e.g., losses, delays) to allocate the ECN marks to different paths.\r\n\r\nI don't think this could work. You don't have per packet delay information in the ACK, so that exactly the same ambiguity. And ideally loss should not be correlated with ECN - hopefully you have ECN instead of loss but that also not guaranteed as you might have multiple bottlenecks or other reason for loss.",

For example, when we want to use re-injection in our packet scheduling, we need to make sure that a packet sent on path 1 can also be reinjected on path 2. Therefore, what we did was to use per-path PMTU discovery and the use the minimum PMTU of all paths for each individual path. But indeed, this choice may vary in a different implementation.",

          "body": "There are two parts in this PR.\r\n\r\nFirst, the following sentences:\r\n\r\nThis extension does not change the definition of any transport parameter\r\ndefined in {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}. \r\nInline with the definition in {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}} disable_active_migration\r\nalso disables multipath support, except \"after a client has acted on a\r\npreferred_address transport parameter\" {{Section 18.2. of QUIC-TRANSPORT}}.\r\n\r\nThese sentences are at the right place. I would replace \"any\" by \"all the\" but that's a detail.\r\n\r\nFor the second part, I think that we should solve this problem differently. The current text is the following:\r\n\r\nFurther, it is out of scope for\r\nthis document if the old address can also be used for multipath\r\nafter a client has migrated to the address provided in the preferred_address\r\ntransport parameter. However, it SHOULD NOT be assumed that it is\r\npossible to use both addresses simultaneously without further confirmation\r\nfrom the other host.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to discuss somewhere in the document how the client learns the server address and how preferred address is used. Since we do not have a way for the server to convey the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses in this document, I would suggest a simple approach:\r\n- When preferred address is not used, then the client can only establish multipath flows to the server address\r\n- When preferred address is used, then if a client migrates to one of the preferred addresses according to 9.6 of RFC9000, then it must consider this address as the endpoint of all multipath flows\r\n\r\nI guess that we'll need to define later a transport parameter that provides the list of \"multipath-capable\" addresses of a given server. In the mean time, we should opt for a simple solution.",

There are in fact two pieces to that: logic at the receiver, i.e., the node that chose to receive packets with zero-length CID; and logic at the sender, i.e., the node that accepts to send data on multiple paths towards a node that uses zero-length CID. This is explained in details in the section \"Using Zero-Length connection ID\", so I guess what we need is a reference to that section.",

      "body": "This PR is to resolve issue #1. The description of the path-closing figure is rephrased for better clarity. The path_id_type field in the PATH_ABANDON frame is also added in the figure to give an idea how the type is used. Moreover, one case for single PN is added (where the client receives zero-length CID while the server receives long CID). According to previous discussion, in the single PN case, only the client needs to send out a PATH_ABANDON. The server SHOULD stop sending new data on the path indicated by the PATH_ABANDON frame after receiving it. However, The client may want to repeat the\r\nPATH_ABANDON frame if it sees the server continuing to send data. It is optional for the server to respond with a PATH_ABANDON after it receives a PATH_ABANDON frame from the client. ",

If the goal is to provide accurate measurement of RTT, we don't need that many \"on path ACK\". One per RTT would be enough. Maybe 2 per RTT to be safe. Or the max value of \"ACK Timer\" and \"Path RTT / 2\". Reset that timer for each path after sending an on path RTT. Then, trigger an on path ACK as soon as (1) the timer has expired and (2) a packet has been received.

If it is, the sender will:\r\n\r\n    - Compute a new path RTT sample using the ACK arrival time, the ACK delay indication, and the time at which the packet with this largest PN was sent.\r\n    - Set the largest PN acknowledged on path to the PN that was just processed\r\n    - Remove all packets with PN lower or equal than this largest acknowledged PN from the list of packets sent on this path that are not yet acknowledged by ACKs received from the same path.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

However, the problem is that in RFC9000 both ends don't need a common understanding of the path but now they do, so we need to address this. In our definition in this draft every 4-tuple is a different path and sticking to that makes it less complicated. The problem with NAT rebinding is that only one end see a new 4-tuple. As such we need an explicit signal to tell the other end to create a new path. I propose to simple use path validation for this (to keep change minimal).\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about resetting the congestion window, we can say that the new path can be initialisierend with the cc values from the old path if only the source port changes.",

I guess if you receive the retired CID frame that means that the peer will not send any new packets but you can only be sure that there is no reordering if you received all packets before the packet with the retired CID frame, however, you don't really know how far back you have to look or there could be gaps introduced by the sender. So checking that is not really practical and always waiting for 3 PTOs is therefore just simpler. Or is there is strong reason why it would be needed to release resources on receipt of the retired CID frame already?\r\n\r\nI note that this discussion is also related to the question if we change the path ID with the CID or not. If we retire the path ID together with the CID, it makes more sense to act on the retired CID frame because in this case even if you receive reordered packets, you would not be able to process them as you don't have a valid path ID.",

In order word is an endpoint supposed to retire/forget the CID immediately when it received the retire CID frame and discard any packets with the old CID or might it also what 1-3 PTOs for re-order packet? I didn't find anything in RFC9000 but maybe somebody else that is better in finding this has a pointer to right part...?\r\n\r\nIf the former, meaning you remove it immediately and ignore old packets, that would also mean that you don't have a valid path ID anymore and can't process any ACKs or other control frame with the old path ID anymore. As such you also don't have to wait for 3 PTOs as you might receive packet/frames but can process them anymore. In this case (assuming that the path ID is connected to the CID), one solution could be to recommend to wait 3PTOs before you send the retired CID frame (or just accepting that this might happens and you have time retransmit some packets unnecessarily if you change the CID).\r\n\r\nIf you have a stable path ID, you can retire immediately and ignore packets with the old CID but still process any control frames that are received in packets with the new CID, and respectively have to wait 3 PTO before you can also remove the path id/close the path entirely.\r\n\r\nOr alternatively, you always have to 3 PTOs after the abandon frame before you remove any state including the last used CID but that also means that the retired CID frames doesn't have any impact. And it also means whenever you received a retired CID frame during an active path use, you also need to wait 3 PTOs before you remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The QUIC connection will never have to process these packets.\r\n\r\nThe QUIC server will assume that the client is trying to use a connection that does not exist anymore and could issue a \"stateless reset\" packet, but since the CID has been retired the token in the stateless reset will not match any valid CID for the connection and will have no effect.\r\n\r\nWhich is a long winded way to say that packets arriving after the DCID has been retired will be automatically ignored.

              "body": "I am OK with a soft guidance to send ACK_MP on the \"same path\", but I am opposed to any mandate to always do that. In particular, there is well established practice of combining a high bandwidth long delay path through Geo satellite and a short delay low bandwidth terrestrial path, sending data on the wide path and sending ACK on the short path. Having a shorter control loop does improve performance, for example allowing the congestion window to ramp up twice faster during slow start. Similarly, sending ACK_MP on a reliable path results in better control than sending them on a lossy path results in more reliable control.\r\n\r\nI understand that the \"same path\" practice makes RTT computation easier, but that's only one aspect of the issue, IMHO not the most dominant aspect. In QUIC, most packet losses are detected by noticing that packets sent later on the path are already acknowledged, not by waiting on timers. Sending ACK_MP on a short path will enable faster detection of packet losses by acked number holes, while sending only on the \"return\" path only improve the computation of RTT, which may or may not improve timer-based recovery. (If ACK_MP are *always* sent on the shortest path, then measuring average and deviation of  ACK delays actually provide good input for loss detection timeout.)\r\n\r\nI think we do have an issue with getting good RTT estimates while not using time stamps. This could be fixed by requiring to also replicate some of the ACK_MP on the \"return\" path when possible, and by having implementation keep track of the progress of same path ACK.\r\n\r\nBut trying to mandate same path ACK just won't help, because implementation seeking better congestion control and better loss detection will just ignore the requirement.

If we say anything, it will have to be \"the processing and update of the per path variables is specified in section so and so\", but I am not sure that helps. I would rather check in as is.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is also a longer answer. If the path did not change, the acknowledgement based loss detection (section 6.1 of RFC 9002) could take into account not just the number of \"posterior\" packets acknowledged with that old CID, but also the number of packets acknowledged in the \"new\" number space. That seems logical, but it implies that the acks for the \"old\" CID are not sent later than the acks for the \"new\" CID. This depends on implementation choices, and thus may not be reliable. We could have a discussion.\r\n\r\nSo yes, leave it as is.",

As long as you keep consistency in sending your ACKs, this should not be a big issue. Also note that with network paths having asymmetrical characteristics in forward or backward directions, it might be desirable from a performance viewpoint to send ACKs on some specific paths. See also #190. My main point is that we should not rely on specific scheduling from the peer to make Multipath QUIC work.\r\n\r\nRegarding your second point, I'm not against keeping the reference.

If it does identify it, it will send two path challenges per normal NAT rebinding guidance, only the one on the new path will succeeds, and everything will be fixed. But if it does not, it will only send a path challenge on the new path, to confirm continuity. Due to asymmetric knowledge, the peer sees only one path, so the challenge arrives on the existing path.

Sorry.\r\n\r\nGeneral idea:\r\n\r\n1- loss detection will be mostly triggered by the ACK sent on the shortest return path, because with RACK most loss detection is triggered by packet number comparisons, not by timers. That means losses are detected faster if enough ACK travel on the shortest return path, which tends to improve performance quite a bit.\r\n\r\n2- ACKing packets faster leads to lower memory utilisation, as packets get out of the retransmit queue faster.\r\n\r\n3- Still, we need timer measurements to compute the PTO and deal with the loss of the \"last packet\".  Just feeding all RTT samples into the algorithms works, because the combination of `SmoothedRTT` and `RTTvar` will capture both the characteristics of the paths and whatever algorithm is implemented by the peer. The PTO formula incorporates both average and variance, and thus the PTO ends up making sense.",

I forgot that I had a separate PR for that.\r\n\r\n> First, I think the question if you should save any CIDs for NAT rebindings is independent of the multipath extension and more a general question for QUIC; yes, without multipath NAT is probably the main use case but still the sender could decide to use a new CID any time.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a general problem. In RFC 9000, we have the following statement: _An endpoint that exhausts available connection IDs cannot probe new paths or initiate migration, nor can it respond to probes or attempts by its peer to migrate. To ensure that migration is possible and packets sent on different paths cannot be correlated, endpoints SHOULD provide new connection IDs before peers migrate_ ([section 9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-9.5-9)).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should add a reference.\r\n\r\n> Second, given you have multiple paths in use, it might be less of a problem if one path breaks because of NAT. So I can well image that there might be cases where you rather use your last CID for a new path then save it for a potentially NAT rebinding on one of the existing path.\r\n\r\nDepending on how Multipath is used, connections could become more susceptible to NAT rebindings. In QUIC v1, backup paths are expected to be established through different networks, meaning that there is low probability of multiple paths getting rebound at the same time. But in case of Multipath, one of the intended use case is to open multiple paths through the same network (so that the tunnel being built on top of QUIC serving multiple end-to-end flows can have a fair share of bandwidth against other flows). In such a use case, all paths would be affected by a single NAT device doing a rebind.\r\n\r\nThat said...\r\n\r\n> Therefor I think it is okay to mention the fact that CIDs might also be needed for NAT rebindings on existing paths but I really wouldn't use normative language here.\r\n\r\nI think I agree that we do not need a normative clause here.

I would be equally fine with removing \"or ceasing to recognize late acknowledgements\" entirely, as loss recovery logic can be discarded anytime when acks aren't expected, it is not specific to this particular case.",

The resulting codes become:\r\n\r\nValue                                              | Frame Name          \r\n---------------------------------------------------|--------------------\r\nTBD-00 - TBD-01 (experiments use 0x15228c00-0x15228c01) | ACK_MP    \r\nTBD-02 (experiments use 0x15228c05)                  | PATH_ABANDON   \r\nTBD-03 (experiments use 0x15228c06)                  | PATH_STATUS \r\n\r\nFor the error code, this PR replaces the human generated code `0xba00` by `0x1001d76d3ded42f3`, a 62 bit number that happens to match the first 64 bits of the MD5 hash of \"QUIC MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION\" (`0x1001d76d3ded42f39ec8a11a3d4734d9`).\r\n\r\nValue                       | Code                  | Description\r\n----------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------\r\nTBD (experiments use 0x1001d76d3ded42f3)| MP_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION | Multipath protocol violation \r\n\r\nThese new numbers conform with [Section 22.1.2. of RFC 9000, Selecting Codepoints](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-selecting-codepoints). The varint encoding of the frame types is 32 bit long, which is the same as the encoding of the previous values and thus will not affect performance. The varing encoding of the error code is 64 bit long, which is more that the 16 bits previously used, but the size of a fatal error code is unlikely to affect performance significantly.",

We need to have a consistent view of how many paths are currently in use between the two peers.\r\n\r\nThat's an important point that we need to make it clear. I think it's better to reuse than increment, as we can add some limitation for the corner cases(e.g. Path Identifier can only be reused after 3 max PTOs after the path is abandoned and all the CIDs belonging to this path is retired). It's more friendly for resource limitation of endpoints. \r\n\r\nIf we use increment, then we need to discuss when to increase the max Path Identifier in the new connection IDs without breaking the limitation for max concurrent paths.",

I think three key points need to be fixed:\r\n> \r\n> * the CID should be uniquely identified by their sequence number, not by the combination of path-id and sequence number.\r\n> * we do not need MP_RETIRE_CID\r\n> * we should never reuse path-ID, because they are part of the cryptographic nonce.\r\n\r\n@huitema I think the first 2 points are for the same design mechanism: whether the CID sequence should be allocated for per path. So basically we have 2 main issues here:\r\n\r\n* whether the CID sequence and Retire Prior to should be allocated for per path, or the whole connection use the same sequence:  For this part, my opinion is \"per path\" is better than \"the whole connection\". Because if different paths use the same sequence for CIDs, endpoints would not be able to use \"Retire Prior To\" to retire CIDs with continuous sequence. It will eventually retire CIDs from other paths and may have unexpected effects.\r\n* \"reuse\" or \"increase and no-reuse\" for path-ID:  For this part, I prefer \"increase and no-reuse\" for security consideration as Path ID are part of the cryptographic nonce. Then we will need mechanism for the limitation of max active Path IDs. Marten's design for PATH_LIMIT { highest path ID} frame might be an available way to solve this problem.",

Then there is the risk of confusion, what happens if old packets are delivered from a previous path using the path identifier.\r\n\r\nWe should make this very clear in the design. If the design goes for \"re-use\", then the node has to allocate an array of number spaces for the negotiated max number of spaces, and keep that for the duration of the connection.

Reuse the design for connection IDs: limit the number of **active** paths. The max number of active CIDs is signalled as a transport parameter (`active_connection_id_limit`) and an endpoint is allowed to issue a new CID only after the peer has retired a previous CID. Analogously, an endpoint would only issue CIDs for a new path after a previous path had been abandoned.\r\n2. Use a `MP_MAX_PATHS` frame to dynamically allow new paths (similar to a `MAX_STREAMS` frame).\r\n\r\nIn short summary, 1. has less signalling and 2. can dynamically adapt the number of concurrent paths.

If also servers will be able to open paths, client-initiated path could use even path IDs and server-initiated path odd path IDs -- a direct reuse of the stream design.\r\n\r\nIt's actually another way to somehow ''split'' the path ID spaces of endpoints. It solves the second problem as @qdeconinck pointed out. The only thing is how we define the TPs which limit the number of concurrent paths.  There might be some options here. For examples:\r\n1. We use one TP to indicate the number of concurrent paths that the sender is willing to accept. For instance, if both endpoints send ''2'', there will be four concurrent paths at maximum (each endpoint can initiate two paths). \r\n2. We use two TPs where one indicates the max number of paths to be accepted by the sender and another one represents the max number of paths the sender wishes to initiate. This design allows endpoints to negotiate the total number of concurrent paths while the former one just informs the local decision to a peer.",

In the current design, stream IDs are allocated as part of CID, and there is no guarantee that client and server pick the same ID for a new path. DO we want to also handle that?",

I also think that we would get much better clarity if the client and server ended up using the same path ID values. Something like:\r\n\r\n1. The client proposes an initial number of paths, which limits how many path ID the server can \"pre allocate\" (to use @Yanmei-Liu terms)\r\n2. Both the server and the client pre-allocate connection identifiers, with path ID lower than the proposed limits.\r\n3. Client that starts a new path picks one of the server allocated CID, selecting the path ID.\r\n4. Server receiving a packet referencing a not yet use path ID must reply with client-allocated connection ID mentioning the same path ID.\r\n    - If the client has not yet allocated any such path ID, the server cannot send data on that new path.\r\n    - the client can always provide a new CID in messages containing a path challenge.\r\n    - the server can control how many paths will be open by simply limiting how many path ID it mentions.\r\n3. \"Abandon path(N)\" is handled pretty much like connection close, but just for the path. Any peer can send it, but the path is only closed if both do, or if RTO pass.\r\n    - if a path is abandoned, we should say what happens if the peer keeps using it. Drop the packets? Repeat the Abandon Path message?\r\n4. Path ID cannot be reused. If a path_id is abandoned, all CID allocated for that path should be retired.\r\n5. The client can use a MAX_PATH_ID frame to increase the number of supported paths.\r\n\r\n",
